# AGENTS.md — ThreeNative

Rules for any agent here; the closest nested `AGENTS.md` wins for its subtree. **Every `CLAUDE.md` is generated**: edit `AGENTS.md`, then run `pnpm sync:agents` (CI runs `--check`). Diagrams are Mermaid, never ASCII.

## What this is

One source, two runtimes: browser WebGPU and an owned C++ host for desktop/Android/iOS. Godot vocabulary, React/Tailwind UI, vanilla `three` underneath, MIT. Studio, the paid editor, is a private repo this one knows nothing about. **Agents write the games, humans only play them**: framework quality is friction per cold-agent build; a human grades the templates.
**Conventions ship on by default** (feet meet the floor, a weapon stays in the hand that holds it, an agent walks around a wall, one metre is one metre), each with a named override on the same object, honest reporting when overridden, and measurement that survives the override. A convention missing from the templates' `AGENTS.md` does not exist. **Auto by default**: if the engine can measure a value where it is used, it decides; a constant the author must revisit later is a bug.

## How you work

1. **Search the manifest before you write — by rule, not judgement.** Run `engine_search_capabilities`, then `engine_capability_detail` on every hit, before any new file under `src/` or `packages/`, any helper longer than a screen, and any render stage you toggle. Skipping it has shipped 446 hand-written lines of an installed system at 9 FPS. The manifest (`packages/create-threenative/capabilities.json`, rebuilt by `pnpm build`) is the only complete public surface, including subpath exports like `@threenative/physics/navigation`. Both tools ship in `threenative-engine-mcp`, wired by the `.mcp.json` that installing `@threenative/core` writes; launch from the game-project root or the server is missing.
   Then be lazy (the `ponytail` skill, re-injected by the project hooks; `PONYTAIL=off` opts out): YAGNI, installed system, stdlib/platform, one line. Never simplify away validation, error handling, security, accessibility or requested behaviour.
2. **Name the layer before fixing a bug**: engine (`packages/`) or game (example/template), and why. An engine bug fixed in game code leaves every other game broken.
3. **Red-green for behaviour changes and bugfixes**: reproduce, fix, rerun. No manufactured failures for planning or prose.
4. **Never claim a gate you did not run.** Report the actual result in the PRD, PR or response; "unverified" is acceptable.
5. **Keep the PRD current as you work.** Tick each box the moment its work is done and verified, with the result beside it, in the same commit as the change. Never tick unrun, partial or unverified work — leave it open and say why. Run `pnpm prd:progress <prd file>` before starting and after each phase; it prints the PR label and exits 1 when the PRD lacks per-phase boxes — fix that first. Filing rules: `docs/PRDs/AGENTS.md`; lifecycle: the `prd-lifecycle` skill.
6. **Surgical.** Touch only what the task needs; tidying is its own change. Ask when the request is ambiguous.
7. **Primary docs follow the executables.** README, `docs/architecture/` and package AGENTS files name only shipped commands and packages (`scripts/__tests__/primary-docs.spec.ts`); fix the prose, not the code.

## Pull requests

- **Small changes skip the PR**: a tiny fix, a docs-only edit, a mirror regeneration — anything with no PRD — commits directly to local `develop` after its relevant checks pass.
- **One PR per PRD**, opened as a draft at the first commit — never one per phase, never several PRDs in one PR. Label it with the `prd:25/50/75/100` that `pnpm prd:progress` prints and update the label as phases land.
- Branch from `origin/develop` (not a local branch that may be ahead of it), target `develop`, squash-merge. Set `git config threenative.integrationBranch develop` per checkout.
- The commit that finishes a PRD also `git mv`s it to `docs/PRDs/done/`.
- `main` takes only the ordinary full-checked `develop -> main` PR, merged with a merge commit, never squash or rebase.
- **No workflow file per feature**: add its CI proof as a job in an existing workflow.
- Before retargeting, inventory `gh pr list` and `pnpm worktree:status`; retarget in-flight PRs one at a time and never rewrite another worktree.

## Where a change goes

| Adding | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Anything that **decides how it looks** — materials, shaders, TSL, lights, tonemapping, post, framing — and any preset or default picking one | `templates/*/src/render/`, as generated user source |
| The **mechanism** that puts it on screen — pooling, lifetime, billboarding, instancing, dispatch, culling — with every appearance parameter from the game; plumbing every game repeats | `packages/core/src/` |
| Physics or navigation (WASM dep) · React HUD/menu bindings · C++ host, platform bring-up, native systems · scenario harness and assertions | `packages/physics/` · `ui/` · `runtime-native/` · `playtest/` |
| Gameplay, never in a package · proof that any of it works | an example or template · `<package>/__tests__/*.spec.ts` **and** a playtest scenario |

`examples/abyss-vanilla/` is a frozen control — do not edit. `docs/architecture/CHARTER.md` outranks this file; open it only when changing what the framework *is*, and quote its rule in plain words, not a section number.

## Rules that get a change rejected

1. **The two questions.** (a) Could the game write this portably itself? If not — it needs a browser global, a platform seam, or a backend it must not know about — the framework owns it, at any size. (b) Does it decide how anything looks? Then it ships as generated source in `src/render/`, at any size. (b) vetoes (a).
2. **Kill switch.** An abstraction costing more code than plain Three.js is deleted; `scripts/count-loc.ts` scores every repetition.
3. **Never own the look.** Geometry, material, colour, texture, curve and timing come from the game; it must be able to change the appearance completely without editing package code. `GPUParticles3D` is the shape.
4. **Borrow vocabulary**: Godot for nodes (the only node source), Three.js for rendering, Rapier for physics, Tailwind for UI, in camelCase. **A package exists only when it carries a dependency the others must not inherit.**
5. **Closed, outranking rule 1**: an IR, a scene format, an editor, a preset/genre system, a code-first ECS, a bespoke CLI vocabulary. **Web-only is unfinished**: a helper admitted for being unportable ships native proof (a conformance case or a `--target` playtest) in the same commit, and no result claims a platform it did not run on. Contract: `packages/runtime-native/AGENTS.md`.

**CI.** The pre-push hook runs `pnpm ci:fast` drift checks only; it proves no runtime behaviour. `pnpm ci:local --full` runs the full board; `pnpm ci:local --affected --base origin/develop --target develop` runs what CI would select (dirty or unknown inputs fall back to full). A change touching only Markdown that no fixture consumes (not `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) runs no CI job; everything else, plus main PRs, main pushes and nightly, is full. `ci-required` rejects missing or failed selected checks; full keeps `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`, `budgets`, `supply-chain`, unit/browser/playtest gates, `golden-path`, `template-nonvisual`. `native-platforms.yml` (including `desktop-parity`) **blocks the merge** when a full selection touches native code, targets `main`, or cannot prove itself native-free. A new commit on a PR head re-runs its checks. Reuse a verdict only for an identical whole-repo tree that CI itself passed. Details: `docs/PRDs/done/PRD-373-selective-ci-and-develop-promotion.md`.
Registry commands read auth from `~/.npmrc`; pass a checkout-local untracked `.npmrc` with `npm --userconfig .npmrc <command>`. Never print either file.

TypeScript 5.9 `strict`, **ESM only**; relative imports end in `.js`. Versions come from the `catalog:` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, templates excepted. Biome formats — never hand-format. Interfaces are `I`-prefixed; classes and type aliases are not. Unit tests: `<package>/__tests__/*.spec.ts`, vitest, node environment, DOM and GPU stubbed.

**Existing harnesses — use them, don't rebuild them.** Capability lookup: `capabilities.json`, `packages/engine-mcp`. Behaviour on browser/Android/desktop/iOS: `packages/playtest --target <platform>`. User-like install and agent-friction arms: `pnpm sandbox`, `pnpm sweep:capture|judge|pair`, `scripts/score-blind.ts`. Visual baselines and LOC vs plain Three.js: `pnpm visuals`, `visuals:ab`, `visuals:baseline`, `pnpm tsx scripts/count-loc.ts`. Web-vs-native, profiling, frame meters: `pnpm parity` (`packages/runtime-native/conformance/registry.json`), `profile:native-cpu`, `bench:engines`, playtest `perf --file|--executable|--logcat`. What to verify next: `pnpm round:next`, `round:deletions`, `alpha:bar`.

## Verification

Results go in the existing PRD, PR or response; a separate evidence file only when the user asks or a workflow consumes it. Prose edits need only the doc checks and mirror regeneration — no implementation checkpoints or artificial negative controls.

**Fail closed**: malformed input throws, a missing observation fails, an empty assertion set fails. `pnpm test` proves units; **a playtest scenario proves the game** — every runtime-behaviour change gets one, rerun on each later change to that behaviour.
**Nearest lane first, CI last.** A CI round trip costs over an hour; prove it locally (unit test, playtest, emulator, attached device) and push once green. **Prefer an emulator over hardware** when it can hold the claim; a stopped emulator means start it, not "blocked". Never call `xvfb-run` (its exit status is its own cleanup kill; `sh scripts/xvfb.sh <cmd>` is the wrapper). An unnamed WebGPU adapter may be SwiftShader: pass `--browser-recipe webgpu` and check `adapter.info`. Free a port with `lsof -ti tcp:<port> | xargs -r kill`; `pkill -f vite` kills your own shell.
Long gates write `artifacts/gates/status.json`: read it with `pnpm gate:status`, probe a stale phase with `pnpm gate:doctor`; `pnpm gate:resume` continues only while worktree, branch, HEAD, lease and artifact still match. None of them repair or remove a worktree.

## Working outside the repo

`pnpm sandbox` builds a user-like machine: tarball installs, no workspace, no `AGENTS.md` chain. Sandbox games live outside this repo, one per folder; engine fixes go into `packages/` and are reinstalled, never patched into the copy. Device lanes: `packages/runtime-native/AGENTS.md`; PRD filing and round ledger: `docs/PRDs/AGENTS.md`. Other agents share this tree — commit as you go, or uncommitted edits get overwritten.
`.worktrees/` and `.claude/worktrees/` hold other agents' lanes, so never search them and never read their AGENTS.md. Generated sweep arm sources and scaffold instruction files are untracked; their benchmark records (`proof.json`, `proof-artifacts/`, captures) stay tracked. A tracked `.ignore` hides `docs/PRDs/done/` and the `CLAUDE.md` mirrors from default search only; reach them with `rg --no-ignore <pattern>` or by naming the directory.
