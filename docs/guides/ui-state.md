# State and UI

Publish game values such as score and health, show them in a React HUD on web and native, and
send player actions back to the game.

## Game state

Gameplay writes state with `ctx.state.set(patch)`. The change is visible to `getState()` at once.

```ts
ctx.state.set((state) => ({ score: state.score + 1 }));
const score = ctx.state.getState().score;
```

Pass a function when the new value depends on the old one. Keep state to plain data, such as
numbers, strings and arrays, because it crosses to the UI as a snapshot.

ThreeNative publishes all changes from one frame as a single UI update when that frame draws.
`getPublishedState()` returns the last published snapshot. If you want fewer updates, set
`stateFlushMs` in `defineGame`. Do not add your own polling loop.

## Shared HUD for web and native

Wrap the UI in `UiLayer`. Inside it, `useUiState` reads published state and `useUiIntent` sends
actions. The same components then run in the browser and in the native runtime, where the UI can
live in another process.

```tsx
import { useUiIntent, useUiState } from "@threenative/ui";
import type { GameState } from "../state.js";

export function Hud() {
  const score = useUiState<GameState, number>((state) => state.score);
  const send = useUiIntent();
  return (
    <section aria-label="Game HUD">
      <output>{score ?? "Loading…"}</output>
      <button type="button" data-tn-interactive onClick={() => send("pause")}>
        Pause
      </button>
    </section>
  );
}
```

`useUiState` returns `undefined` until the game publishes its first state, so render a
placeholder. Mark every control the player touches with `data-tn-interactive`. The runtime uses
it to route pointer input to the UI instead of the game.

## Handle intents

An intent is a named request from the UI, such as `pause` or `restart`. The game decides what
each name means and can ignore any of them.

```ts
game.ui.onIntent((intent, payload) => {
  if (intent === "restart") void game.goto("play");
  if (intent === "pause") game.pause();
  if (intent === "resume") game.resume();
});
```

Validate the payload and check the current game state here. The same rules then apply whether an
action comes from a button, a key or a gamepad.

## Web-only components

On the web you can read state straight from the game object with `useGameState(game, selector)`.
Use it only from the web UI entry, never from shared UI code.

```tsx
import type { IGame } from "@threenative/core";
import type { IPhysicsContext } from "@threenative/physics";
import { useGameState } from "@threenative/ui";
import type { GameState } from "../state.js";

export function Score({ game }: { game: IGame<GameState, IPhysicsContext> }) {
  const score = useGameState(game, (state) => state.score);
  return <output aria-label="Score">{score}</output>;
}
```

`GameCanvas` mounts the game in a React page. Render it first so the UI paints on top. Let the
scene update 3D objects and let React update the interface.

## UI renderer

`ui.renderer` in `threenative.config.ts` picks how `src/ui/` draws.

| Value | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| `"web"` (default) | React DOM, CSS, SVG and fonts on every target, drawn over the game surface by the platform's web renderer |
| `"native"` | React mapped to `CanvasLayer` quads inside the rendered frame. No web view, no CSS, no extra process. |

The starter template uses `"web"` with a React HUD and menu. The minimal template uses `"native"`,
draws its HUD in the scene and has no `src/ui/`.

`DebugOverlay` shows development diagnostics. Press backtick to open it. Generated projects include
its styles. If you add it to another project, supply CSS that positions it above the canvas.

On native builds, test pause and resume, keyboard focus, text size and touch in the packaged game.
See [Native runtime](native-runtime.md) for platform requirements.
