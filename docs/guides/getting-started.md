# Get started

ThreeNative is a framework that ships one Three.js codebase to the web, desktop and Android. Create
a game, run it and write your first scene.

## Requirements

You need Node 20.19 or newer and pnpm 10 or newer. The game runs in any browser with WebGPU, or
falls back to WebGL2. You can add native build tools and Blender later.

```sh
node --version
pnpm --version
```

## Create and run

```sh
pnpm create threenative my-game --template minimal
cd my-game
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the local URL that Vite prints. The default template is `starter`, a game with a React HUD.
This guide uses `minimal`, which draws its HUD in the scene. Other templates include
`platformer`, `action-rpg`, `defense`, `racing`, `sailing` and `shooter`.

If you use npm, pass template flags after `--`:

```sh
npm create threenative@latest my-game -- --template minimal
cd my-game
npm install
npm run dev
```

Pick one package manager and keep its lockfile. If setup fails, run doctor from the game directory.
It reports missing tools and configuration:

```sh
pnpm exec threenative doctor --text --target web
```

## Project files

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/game.ts` | The shared game: scenes, input, plugins and settings. |
| `src/main.ts` | The browser entry. It starts the game and attaches the canvas. |
| `src/scenes/` | Scenes that load, add objects, update gameplay and clean up. |
| `src/entities/` | Game objects such as the player. |
| `src/render/` | Materials, lights, camera, effects, HUD and the loading screen. |
| `src/state.ts` | The typed game state, such as score. |
| `public/` | Files served to the game, such as icons. |
| `threenative.config.ts` | App name, display, window, renderer, native entry and UI options. |
| `playtests/` | Scenarios that drive the game and check the results. |

The `starter` template also has `src/ui/` for the React HUD and `assets/` for source assets.

## Check the project

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build:web
pnpm test
```

`pnpm test` builds the web game and runs the playtests in a headed Playwright browser with WebGPU.
On a headless machine, set up a display and GPU first. Commit the project before you edit it.

## Your first scene

Replace `src/game.ts` with the code below. Keep `src/main.ts`, the stylesheet and the config. The
cube uses an unlit material, so it needs no lights, physics or models.

```ts
import { defineGame, Scene, type ICtx } from "@threenative/core";
import { playtest } from "@threenative/core/playtest";
import { BoxGeometry, Color, Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial } from "three";
import config from "../threenative.config.js";

type DemoState = { x: number };

class FirstScene extends Scene<DemoState> {
  private cube: Mesh<BoxGeometry, MeshBasicMaterial> | undefined;

  override enter(ctx: ICtx<DemoState>): void {
    const geometry = new BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
    const material = new MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x70e0b0 });
    this.cube = ctx.add(new Mesh(geometry, material));
    ctx.scene.background = new Color(0x0d1b2a);
    ctx.camera.position.set(0, 1.5, 5);
    ctx.camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
  }

  override update(ctx: ICtx<DemoState>, dt: number): void {
    if (this.cube === undefined) return;
    const move = ctx.input.vector("move");
    const x = Math.max(-2, Math.min(2, this.cube.position.x + move.x * 2 * dt));
    this.cube.position.x = x;
    this.cube.rotation.y += dt;
    ctx.state.set({ x });
  }

  override exit(): void {
    // These resources belong only to this scene, not a shared asset cache.
    this.cube?.removeFromParent();
    this.cube?.geometry.dispose();
    this.cube?.material.dispose();
    this.cube = undefined;
  }
}

export default defineGame<DemoState>({
  initialState: { x: 0 },
  input: { move: {
    left: ["KeyA", "ArrowLeft"], right: ["KeyD", "ArrowRight"],
  } },
  plugins: [playtest()],
  render: config.renderer,
  display: config.display,
  scenes: { first: FirstScene },
  start: "first",
  step: 1 / 60,
});
```

Save, then press A and D or the arrow keys. The cube spins, slides sideways and stops at x = -2 and
x = 2. Change its color, speed or limits, then run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build:web`.

ThreeNative supplies the timing and input. The scene owns the mesh and the movement rule. When the
scene ends, `exit` frees the geometry and material it created.

The template playtests check the original player, pickup and score, so they fail against this
scene. Write a scenario that checks `x` and its limits. The code already installs `playtest()`. To
run the original scenarios, restore the template's `src/game.ts`.

If a step fails, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
