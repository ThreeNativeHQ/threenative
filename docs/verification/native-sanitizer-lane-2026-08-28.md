## Red-green evidence

The lane first failed at link time because UBSan's `vptr` check requires RTTI symbols that the
prebuilt V8 and Skia archives do not export. The final build keeps
`-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer` while narrowly excluding only `vptr`.

Once linked, LeakSanitizer exposed two engine leaks: V8 weak-release records were not owned at
teardown, and four WebGPU registries were never released by `destroyBindingsState`. After those
engine fixes, the real lane passed:

```text
Test Files 3 passed (3)
Tests 18 passed (18)

100% tests passed out of 6
native-sanitizer = 12.19 sec*proc (6 tests)
```

Leak detection remains enabled. The generated dated suppression file names only DBus process
state, three NVIDIA userspace-driver modules, and Dawn's Vulkan queue. Each entry carries its own
reason; there is no `detect_leaks=0` or unknown-module suppression.

## Negative control

A disposable `-O0` executable deleted an integer and then read it. The instrumented executable
failed closed and surfaced the source line:

```text
ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free
READ of size 4
SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free prd229-asan-negative.cpp:6 in main
NEGATIVE_EXIT=1
```
