# PRD-196 published-install verification

Status: **BLOCKED on candidate-cohort preparation and release credentials.** The implementation's
applicable source gates are green in the tree; the native contract suite remains unbuilt. The source
cohort cannot be published as-is: eight package versions are immutable on npm and their source moved
after publication. A release owner must first
prepare and commit a fresh coherent eleven-package cohort, then publish it with a matching
`runtime-native-v*` release. The PRD is filed at
`docs/PRDs/BLOCKED/requires-release-credentials/PRD-196-published-install-is-functional.md`.

The sections below are in run order. **Repair round 8 (2026-09-08) is the current state** — it
re-ran every earlier claim at the lane tip and is the section to read first.

Lane: `lane-196`
Date: 2026-08-23
Worktree: `prd-196-published-install-is-functional`

The implementation is committed on the lane branch. The public `runtime-native-v0.3.0`
release was not cut from this lane: the worker is prohibited from pushing or creating releases.
Consequently, the consumer desktop, Android APK, and registry/MCP end-to-end criteria remain
UNVERIFIED. The checks below record what did run and what failed.

## Source and test-path note

The PRD names `packages/runtime-native/__tests__/install-prebuilt.spec.ts`, but this checkout's
active runtime test is `packages/runtime-native/tests/distribution.test.mjs` under the package's
`vitest.config.ts`. That existing test file was extended and run with the package configuration.

## Green implementation gates

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | PASS |
| `pnpm typecheck` | PASS; all workspace package checks completed |
| `pnpm lint` | PASS; 293 report-only complexity warnings |
| `pnpm test` | The first package phase was externally interfered with; its successful resume plus the direct unit phase passed. See repair round 1 below. |
| `pnpm budgets` | PASS; LOC/census messages are existing report-only warnings |
| `pnpm quality` | PASS; 71 report-only findings, including the changed doctor's 467-line file-length report |
| runtime distribution suite | PASS — 16 tests |
| doctor suite | PASS — 16 tests |
| scaffold suite | PASS — 21 tests |
| publish-state suite | PASS — 22 tests |
| registry verifier suite | PASS — 11 tests |
| sandbox suite | PASS — 18 tests |
| engine MCP suite | PASS — 11 tests |

## Repair round 1 — reviewer defects

### Observed red before repair

Commands:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts \
  -t "fails the publish report when an optional template pin still uses workspace:"
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts \
  -t "fails when the native verifier produces no 300-frame proof|fails when doctor text omits the target census"
pnpm exec vitest run packages/create-threenative/__tests__/doctor.spec.ts \
  -t "lists web, desktop, Android, and iOS target availability|fails when install status belongs to a stale runtime version|fails when install status names a stale release URL"
```

Output:

```text
check-publish-state: 1 failed, 21 skipped
  expected exitCode 1, received 0

verify-registry-install: 2 failed, 9 skipped
  native verifier control: expected exitCode 1, received 0
  doctor census control: expected exitCode 1, received 0

doctor: 3 failed, 13 skipped
  no check named 'target web'
  stale version: expected report.pass false, received true
  stale URL: expected report.pass false, received true
```

### Green after repair

```text
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts
  Test Files 1 passed (1); Tests 22 passed (22)

pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts
  Test Files 1 passed (1); Tests 11 passed (11)

pnpm exec vitest run packages/create-threenative/__tests__/doctor.spec.ts
  Test Files 1 passed (1); Tests 16 passed (16)

pnpm typecheck
  exit 0

pnpm lint
  exit 0; 293 report-only warnings

pnpm budgets
  exit 0

pnpm quality
  exit 0; 71 report-only findings
```

The first `pnpm test` attempt was interrupted by another repository run changing the global
`/tmp/threenative-*` count from 84 to 87. Its first package-phase resume then observed another
worker's Playwright PID `2080741` after the orphan baseline. No foreign process was killed. Once
that process exited, the recorded package phase resumed successfully:

```text
pnpm gate:resume
  package-test: exit 0
  runtime-native: 50 files passed; 333 passed, 37 skipped
  native physics parity: 28 TypeScript tests and 2 Rust tests passed
  suite temporary directory count unchanged: 85

pnpm exec vitest run
  Test Files 192 passed, 1 skipped (193)
  Tests 1,869 passed, 3 skipped (1,872)
  exit 0
```

The repair removed `packages/runtime-native/scripts/install-prebuilt.d.mts`. Both TypeScript
callers now load the executable `install-prebuilt.mjs` contract dynamically; the installed runtime
module remains the single owner of `releaseManifestUrl()`.

## Negative controls observed red before green

These were run while each phase's test or consumer was still pointing at the old/missing path:

| Phase | Red observation |
|---|---|
| 1 | Runtime distribution tests failed for the dead `jonit-dev` URL, missing `writeInstallStatus`, and missing `PREBUILT_KEYS`; doctor native-runtime cases failed before the check was wired. |
| 2 | The workflow key-table test failed while `.github/workflows/native-release.yml` had no `PREBUILT_KEYS` check. |
| 3 | Publish-state tests failed while `templatePinCensus` and `prebuiltReleaseCensus` were not exported or assembled. |
| 4 | Registry verifier tests failed while the flow still had only scaffold/install/lockfile/build/test; native, doctor, and MCP assertions had no live steps. |
| 5 | Sandbox package-list/flag tests and the short runtime override test failed before the new package table and alias were added. |

The declared status-file control was also run red-first: with the status file deleted, the temporary
expectation of a hard failure produced `expected status fail, received warn` with 12 passing and 1
failing test. The contract was corrected to report `warn / unknown — no install status recorded`,
and the final doctor suite passed 13/13. The other final negative cases pass in the changed suites:
missing native output, a timed-out MCP server, unrun steps, absent template pins, absent prebuilt
releases, a corrupted prebuilt download, and a missing runtime binary all produce failures rather
than vacuous green results.

## Final integration proof

### 1. Dead release-host search

Command:

```bash
grep -rn "jonit-dev" packages scripts .github --include='*.mjs' --include='*.ts' --include='*.yml'
```

Output:

```text
packages/runtime-native/scripts/physical-device-evidence.mjs:476:      remote: "https://github.com/jonit-dev/threenative.git",
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml:4:    url: https://github.com/jonit-dev/threenative/discussions
```

Those two references are outside the PRD phase file set and were not edited in this lane.

### 2. New-symbol caller census

Command:

```bash
grep -rn "writeInstallStatus\|templatePinCensus\|prebuiltReleaseCensus\|RELEASE_REPOSITORY" \
  packages scripts --include='*.ts' --include='*.mjs' | grep -v "__tests__" | grep -v ".spec."
```

Output:

```text
packages/runtime-native/scripts/install-prebuilt.mjs:10:export const RELEASE_REPOSITORY = 'ThreeNativeHQ/threenative';
packages/runtime-native/scripts/install-prebuilt.mjs:72:  return `https://github.com/${RELEASE_REPOSITORY}/releases/download/runtime-native-v${encodeURIComponent(version)}/prebuilt-lock.json`;
packages/runtime-native/scripts/install-prebuilt.mjs:75:export function writeInstallStatus(status, statusPath = join(packageRoot, 'prebuilt', 'install-status.json')) {
packages/runtime-native/scripts/install-prebuilt.mjs:143:      .then(() => writeInstallStatus({ key, ok: true, reason: 'installed', url, version: packageVersion }))
packages/runtime-native/scripts/install-prebuilt.mjs:147:          writeInstallStatus({ key, ok: false, reason, url, version: packageVersion });
packages/runtime-native/tests/distribution.test.mjs:13:  RELEASE_REPOSITORY,
packages/runtime-native/tests/distribution.test.mjs:20:  writeInstallStatus,
packages/runtime-native/tests/distribution.test.mjs:76:  assert.equal(RELEASE_REPOSITORY, 'ThreeNativeHQ/threenative');
packages/runtime-native/tests/distribution.test.mjs:85:  writeInstallStatus(
scripts/check-publish-state.ts:171:export function templatePinCensus(
scripts/check-publish-state.ts:251:export function prebuiltReleaseCensus(
scripts/check-publish-state.ts:484:  findings.push(...templatePinCensus(repo, lookup));
scripts/check-publish-state.ts:485:  findings.push(...prebuiltReleaseCensus(repo, options.prebuiltProbe));
```

The non-test consumers are the installer CLI branch and release URL builder, and the
`checkPublishState` report assembly.

### 3. Real registry clean-room command

Command:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/verify-registry-install.ts
```

Output:

```text
pass  scaffold
FAIL  install
      npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
      npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
FAIL  lockfile
      Not run: the install step failed to produce an installed project.
FAIL  build
      Not run: the install step failed to produce an installed project.
FAIL  test
      Not run: the install step failed to produce an installed project.
FAIL  doctor
      Not run: the install step failed to produce an installed project.
FAIL  native
      Not run: the install step failed to produce an installed project.
FAIL  mcp
      Not run: the install step failed to produce an installed project.
The registry install path is broken. This is alpha row A1.
```

The scaffold reached the registry, but the currently published package still contains
`workspace:*`; the fail-closed step list is the expected diagnostic.

### 4. Prebuilt release probe

Command:

```bash
curl -sI "https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/releases/download/runtime-native-v$(node -p \
  "require('./packages/runtime-native/package.json').version")/prebuilt-lock.json" | head -1
```

Output:

```text
HTTP/2 404
```

No release URL or asset SHA-256 is claimed until the external `runtime-native-v0.3.0` release is
created.

## Repair round 2 — final read-only review defects

Status: **IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED; external release checkpoint remains UNVERIFIED**

### Installed desktop verifier: observed red before repair

After bootstrapping the fresh worktree with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, the installed-package
regression failed before the fake starter executable could start:

```bash
pnpm --filter @threenative/runtime-native exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts \
  tests/distribution.test.mjs -t "an installed runtime verifier uses packaged Linux display support"
```

```text
FAIL tests/distribution.test.mjs > an installed runtime verifier uses packaged Linux display support
Error: Command failed: /home/joao/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.6/bin/node /tmp/threenative-installed-verifier-FQ1mBU/consumer/node_modules/@threenative/runtime-native/scripts/verify-starter-desktop.mjs
TN_NATIVE_STARTER_EXIT_127:

sh: /tmp/threenative-installed-verifier-FQ1mBU/consumer/node_modules/scripts/xvfb.sh: No such file or directory

Tests 1 failed, 16 skipped; exit 1
```

The repair packages `packages/runtime-native/scripts/xvfb.sh`, resolves it beside the installed
verifier, and preserves the wrapped command's exit status. The regression installs the packed
runtime into a temporary consumer project, invokes the installed verifier, and separately observes
the packaged helper returning exit status 7.

### Consumer test command: observed red before repair

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts \
  -t "runs the consumer test command through pnpm"
```

```text
FAIL scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts > pnpm tsx scripts/verify-registry-install.ts > runs the consumer test command through pnpm
AssertionError: expected [ [ 'npm', 'test' ] ] to deeply equal [ [ 'pnpm', 'test' ] ]

Tests 1 failed, 11 skipped; exit 1
```

The verifier now invokes `pnpm test`; the regression records the consumer command and remains
fail-closed for failed steps.

### Green repair verification

```text
installed runtime regression: 1 passed, 16 skipped; exit 0
consumer command regression: 1 passed, 11 skipped; exit 0
runtime distribution + starter suites: 2 files passed; 21 tests passed
registry verifier suite: 1 file passed; 12 tests passed
packaged xvfb status probe: helper_exit=7
```

The status probe also emitted existing Xvfb/xkbcomp warnings; they were non-fatal, and the wrapped
exit status remained 7. No `xvfb-run` was introduced.

The repository gates completed as follows:

```text
pnpm build       exit 0  (bootstrap required declarations and package dist)
pnpm typecheck   exit 0
pnpm lint        exit 0; 293 report-only warnings
pnpm budgets     exit 0; report-only LOC/census messages
pnpm quality     exit 0; 71 report-only findings
```

The full `pnpm test` run executed all 193 test files and 1,873 tests successfully, but the
top-level command exited 1 because the suite-wide temporary-directory guard observed:

```text
temporary directory count changed across the full test suite: before 101, after 102
```

Another lane owns a Playwright process in `test-pipeline-audit-final`; the cross-worktree orphan
guard is therefore not claimed, and no foreign process was killed.

### External clean-room result after repair

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/verify-registry-install.ts
```

```text
pass  scaffold
FAIL  install
      Command failed: npm install
npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*

FAIL  mcp
      Not run: the install step failed to produce an installed project.
The registry install path is broken. This is alpha row A1.
exit 1
```

The external install fails before the new `pnpm test` step can be reached because the currently
published package still contains `workspace:*`. The release probe remains:

```text
HTTP/2 404
```

No external package publication, GitHub release, Android APK, or consumer desktop render is
claimed by this repair lane.

## Repair round 2 follow-up — coordinated publish preflight

Status: **IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED; external release checkpoint remains UNVERIFIED**

### Publish-set pin regression: observed red before the fix

The new fixture pins `@threenative/core@0.1.0`, which is the exact package/version in
`publishSet(root)`. The lookup reports that exact registry version as absent. Before the source
fix, the focused regression failed with the following assertion:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts -t "allows an exact internal pin at the version in the current publish set"
```

```text
FAIL scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts > pnpm publish:check > allows an exact internal pin at the version in the current publish set
AssertionError: expected [ { …(3) } ] to deeply equal []

Expected
[]

Received
[
  {
    "detail": "templates/starter/package.json pins @threenative/core@0.1.0, but the registry has no resolvable version.",
    "package": "template:starter",
    "severity": "fail",
  },
]
```

The paired absent-pin control uses `@threenative/core@9.9.9`, which is not the exact version in
the publish set. A mutation that allowed every absent pin produced its required red result:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts -t "fails when a template pins a package the registry does not have"
```

```text
FAIL scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts > pnpm publish:check > fails when a template pins a package the registry does not have
AssertionError: expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0
```

The fix exempts only `facts.state === "absent"` pins whose complete `name@version` is in
`publishSet(repo)`. `present` remains passing and `unreachable` remains blocked.

### Repair tests and gates

### Updated `PREBUILT_KEYS` caller census

The census command now includes `PREBUILT_KEYS` and the release workflow path; its output is
shown without suppressing the existing test references:

```bash
grep -rn "writeInstallStatus\|templatePinCensus\|prebuiltReleaseCensus\|RELEASE_REPOSITORY\|PREBUILT_KEYS" packages scripts .github --include='*.ts' --include='*.mjs' --include='*.yml' | grep -v "__tests__" | grep -v ".spec."

## Repair round 3 — contract-preserving lane

Status: **IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED; external registry/release gates remain UNVERIFIED**

This round repaired the two blocking review defects without changing the published-release
evidence. The default publish preflight is fail-closed again. The release workflow alone passes the
explicit `--allow-current-publish-set-pins` option, and that option does not suppress pins outside
the current publish set. The MCP verifier now validates every search hit against the published
engine-MCP result shape.

### Required red controls, observed before the repair

The default publish-state regression was run before changing `templatePinCensus`. It failed because
the old implementation returned no finding for an absent exact pin in the current publish set:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts -t "rejects an absent exact internal pin at the version in the current publish set by default"
```

```text
 RUN  v4.1.10 /home/joao/projects/threenative/threenative-engine/.worktrees/prd-196-published-install-is-functional-r3

 ❯ scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts (26 tests | 1 failed | 25 skipped) 49ms
 × rejects an absent exact internal pin at the version in the current publish set by default 46ms
AssertionError: expected [] to deep equally contain ObjectContaining{…}
❯ scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts:223:45

Expected:
ObjectContaining { "package": "template:starter", "severity": "fail" }
Received:
[]

Test Files 1 failed (1)
Tests 1 failed | 25 skipped (26)
```

The MCP malformed-hit control was also run before adding contract validation. `[{}]` was accepted
because the old verifier checked only that the JSON array was non-empty:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts -t "fails when engine MCP returns a malformed capability hit"
```

```text
 RUN  v4.1.10 /home/joao/projects/threenative/threenative-engine/.worktrees/prd-196-published-install-is-functional-r3

 ❯ scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts (13 tests | 1 failed | 12 skipped) 30ms
 × fails when engine MCP returns a malformed capability hit 27ms
AssertionError: expected +0 to be 1 // Object.is equality
- Expected 1
+ Received 0
❯ scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts:259:29

Test Files 1 failed (1)
Tests 1 failed | 12 skipped (13)
```

### Repair tests and relevant full suites

The focused controls are green after the repair:

```text
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts -t "current publish set|coordinated pin opt-in|workflow"
Test Files 1 passed (1)
Tests 5 passed | 21 skipped (26)

pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts -t "every step runs|malformed capability hit"
Test Files 1 passed (1)
Tests 2 passed | 11 skipped (13)

pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts
Test Files 1 passed (1)
Tests 26 passed (26)

pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts
Test Files 1 passed (1)
Tests 13 passed (13)
```

The repository-wide `pnpm test` run completed all package and unit assertions, but the suite
finalizer failed its existing temporary-directory invariant. This is the exact final result; no
test assertion failed:

```text
Test Files 193 passed (193)
     Tests 1878 passed (1878)
temporary directory count changed across the full test suite: before 113, after 114
 ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 1.
```

### Publish preflight mode proof

The default public command remains unchanged and rejects the current unpublished state. It now
reports the absent template pins instead of silently treating them as releasable:

```bash
pnpm publish:check
```

```text
Checked 8 package(s): @threenative/assets, @threenative/core, @threenative/physics, @threenative/playtest, @threenative/runtime-native, @threenative/ui, create-threenative, threenative-engine-mcp

the non-test live callers are the `packages/`, `scripts/`, and `.github/workflows/` lines that are

### Required integration proof after the repair

The dead-host scan still finds only unrelated existing references outside this repair's scope:

```bash
grep -rn "jonit-dev" packages scripts .github --include='*.mjs' --include='*.ts' --include='*.yml'
```

```text
packages/runtime-native/scripts/physical-device-evidence.mjs:476:      remote: "https://github.com/jonit-dev/threenative.git",
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml:4:  url: https://github.com/jonit-dev/threenative/discussions
```

The registry clean-room command was rerun from this worktree and remains red at the external
published package boundary:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/verify-registry-install.ts
```

```text
pass  scaffold
Created starter project at /tmp/threenative-clean-room-uTpINt/my-game

```

```text
HTTP/2 404
```

### Static gates

The fresh worktree required `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm build` before typecheck;
the first typecheck attempt reported missing built workspace modules (`@threenative/playtest/*`
and `@threenative/assets`). After the prescribed build, the required gates completed as follows:

```text
pnpm typecheck: exit 0
pnpm lint: exit 0; 293 report-only complexity warnings
pnpm budgets: exit 0; budgets ok (report-only LOC/native-census drift messages)
pnpm quality: exit 0; quality report: 71 findings (12 new, 8 grew, 51 inherited, 0 waived)
pnpm exec biome check --write <four in-scope TypeScript files>: exit 0; warnings only
git diff --check: exit 0
```

No package publication, GitHub release, Android APK, consumer desktop render, or successful
external MCP call is claimed. The worktree changes for this repair are limited to the five source,
test, and workflow files plus this evidence file.

## Repair round 4 — production-readiness lane, 2026-09-08 (historical pre-rebase record)

Lane: `linchpin/prd-196-production-readiness-20260908`
Worktree: `.worktrees/prd-196-production-readiness-20260908`
Historical base: `76321e46d93f8ece59528315e83b17a644b7a77b` (`origin/main` at that time)
Lane commits under test: `7f2408937`, `1f43d4f31`, `2f4152b53`, and this repair commit.

This round re-ran every claim in the five phase records against the lane tip rather than against
the commit they were written at, and repaired what the re-run contradicted. The five records are
the per-phase evidence and are cited here so the retention gate keeps them:

- [phase 1 — packed core boundary](prd-196-readiness-phase-1-2026-09-08.md)
- [phase 2 — clean npm and pnpm install matrix](prd-196-readiness-phase-2-2026-09-08.md)
- [phase 3 — automatic MCP installation](prd-196-readiness-phase-3-2026-09-08.md)
- [phase 4 — guarded release cohort](prd-196-readiness-phase-4-2026-09-08.md)
- [phase 5 — installed sandbox package injection](prd-196-readiness-phase-5-2026-09-08.md)

### What the re-run found and this commit repaired

| Defect | Evidence | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm budgets` was red: the five phase records were added without regenerating the retention index | `retention index is stale at docs/benchmark/SCREENSHOT-RETENTION.md; regenerate it` — exit 1 | `tsx scripts/generate-retention-index.ts`; the delta is exactly those five files and the `docs/verification` row |
| The five phase records were **uncited**, so the retention lifecycle classed them deletion-eligible | index delta showed them under the uncited list, count 59 → 64 | cited from this ledger and from the PRD |
| The PRD sat in `docs/PRDs/done/` reading `NOT STARTED`; neither was true | moved there by `b45bf21f7`, an unrelated bulk PRD move | filed as `BLOCKED` under `requires-release-credentials/` with the two acts that unblock it |
| The dead release host still shipped: `jonit-dev/threenative` survived in a **published** file | `packages/runtime-native/scripts/physical-device-evidence.mjs:476`, and that file is in the package's `files` list | pointed at `ThreeNativeHQ/threenative`; PRD integration proof 1 now returns nothing |
| Phase records named `7f24089377` as the source under test; two later commits changed the same files | `2f4152b53` changed core packaging, the Blender bundle, `verify-registry-install.ts` and `npm-release.yml` | each record now names the lane tip and the re-measured counts |

### Gates, re-run at the lane tip

```text

pnpm lint                      exit 0 (657 report-only warnings)

```

The bounded documentation/workflow contract lane was also run locally. It is not the prose-only CI
shortcut because this cumulative diff includes executable workflow and package changes:

  scripts/__tests__/make-sandbox.spec.ts

Test Files  5 passed (5)
     Tests  121 passed (121)
```

Per file: `check-publish-state` 40, `make-sandbox` 23, `verify-registry-install` 20,
`mcp-install` 30, `release` 8. The phase records' earlier counts (18 and 29) were taken before
`2f4152b53` added two verifier cases and one MCP case.

The file this round edited is covered by the runtime package's own suites:

```text
pnpm --filter @threenative/runtime-native exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts \
  tests/physical-mobile-qualification.test.mjs tests/distribution.test.mjs

Test Files  2 passed (2)
     Tests  42 passed (42)
```

The whole workspace suite is green at the tip, with the native contract package split out exactly
as CI splits it:

```text
$ TN_SUITE_EXCLUDE_PACKAGES=@threenative/runtime-native pnpm test
Test Files  406 passed | 2 skipped (408)
     Tests  4675 passed | 8 skipped (4683)
  Duration  105.83s
TEST EXIT=0
```

The excluded package is the one recorded as unexecuted below; nothing else was skipped.

### PRD integration proofs

```text
$ grep -rn "jonit-dev" packages scripts .github \
    --include='*.mjs' --include='*.ts' --include='*.yml'
(no output)
```

Before this commit that grep returned `packages/runtime-native/scripts/physical-device-evidence.mjs:476`.

Widening the search past the PRD's own detector finds seven further occurrences, all in
`packages/runtime-native/tests/fixtures/prd056-*.json`. They are left as they are, deliberately:
each is a frozen record of a PRD-056 device run that really happened on the old remote, none is in
`packages/runtime-native/package.json`'s `files` array so none is published, and rewriting recorded
history to satisfy a string search would be the aliasing the criterion forbids. The shipped surface
is clean — `scripts/physical-device-evidence.mjs` was the only file in `files` that named the dead
host.

```text
$ grep -rn "writeInstallStatus\|templatePinCensus\|prebuiltReleaseCensus\|RELEASE_REPOSITORY" \

```

Every symbol has a live non-test consumer.

```text
$ curl -sI ".../releases/download/runtime-native-v0.3.0/prebuilt-lock.json" | head -1

`ThreeNativeHQ/threenative` has one unrelated release, `quiche-owned-v1`; it has no
`runtime-native-v*` release or `prebuilt-lock.json` asset.

### The clean room, re-run at the lane tip

```text
$ SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 pnpm tsx scripts/verify-registry-install.ts

pass  npm:install       pass  pnpm:install

exit 1
```

This is an honest red against the **published** cohort, not against this tree. `create-threenative@0.2.3`
and `@threenative/core@0.3.0` predate the four-server MCP table and the self-contained packing this
lane implements, and no `runtime-native` prebuilt release exists for any version. The gate is
reporting the world as published; the source repairs are in this branch and unpublished.

One criterion of the PRD *is* now met by the published cohort: `pnpm test` is green on first run
in both package managers, with no added flags.

### Release preflight, re-run at the lane tip

```text
$ pnpm publish:check
9 finding(s). This tree must not be published as it stands.
exit 1
```

Eight findings are immutable already-published versions whose source has moved on
(`@threenative/assets` +13 commits, `core` +42, `physics` +4, `playtest` +31, `runtime-native` +23,
`ui` +3, `create-threenative` +43, `threenative-engine-mcp` +5). The ninth is the absent
`runtime-native-v0.3.0` prebuilt release. This is the gate working: it refuses a tree that cannot
be published.

**No version was bumped by this lane.** A bump is a release act that belongs with the publish it
enables: bumping here would clear eight findings, leave the ninth, and leave the tree naming a
cohort that has no release behind it. The versions and the publish must move together, under
credentials this lane does not hold.

### Unexecuted boundaries — recorded, not claimed

| Boundary | Why it did not run | What would run it |
|---|---|---|
| npm publish of the eleven-package cohort | no registry credentials in this lane; the lane is also forbidden to push | `pnpm release --yes` under a publish token |
| `runtime-native-v*` GitHub release | no release-upload rights | `native-release.yml` on a `runtime-native-v*` tag |
| Consumer desktop build and 300-frame render | depends on the prebuilt release above | `threenative build --target desktop` in a scaffolded project |
| Consumer Android APK | same, plus an Android SDK-only host | `threenative build --target android` |
| `engine_search_capabilities` through a **published** project's `.mcp.json` | the published cohort has three servers, not four | re-run `verify-registry-install.ts` after the publish |
| `packages/runtime-native` C++ contract suites | the native host is not built in this worktree; `pnpm native:build` is opt-in and this lane changed no C++, CMake or build file | `pnpm native:build`, then the package suite |

The runtime-native package suite reports `18 failed | 828 passed | 62 skipped`; every failure is an
unbuilt contract executable (`... is not built. Run: cmake --build build/tn-linux-... --target ...`),
which is the split CI already makes into its own job. The lane's merge-base diff contains no
native source, so these are the environment, not the change. They are recorded rather than counted
as green.

## Repair round 5 — independent review corrections, 2026-09-08

The independent review found three evidence defects. The blocker description now names all eight
immutable package versions and states the required preparation step: bump the changed packages to
versions absent from npm, repin the complete template/internal dependency cohort, and commit that
candidate before using publish credentials. The workflow now downloads the pinned official Blender
`5.2.0` Linux archive, validates its version banner, and exports `THREENATIVE_BLENDER_PATH` before
the registry verifier runs its real OBJ-to-GLB MCP conversion.

The two phase controls the reviewer requested were executed against temporary removals and restored
before the green runs. Their exact commands and failing output are retained in the phase records:

```text
phase 2: pnpm --filter @threenative/runtime-native exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts \
  tests/distribution.test.mjs -t "the native release workflow covers every exported prebuilt key"
PHASE_2_NEGATIVE_CONTROL_EXIT=1

phase 5: pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/make-sandbox.spec.ts \
  -t "packs the native runtime and capability server with the user-facing packages"
PHASE_5_NEGATIVE_CONTROL_EXIT=1
```

The current external blocker remains truthful: no candidate cohort was published and no matching
native prebuilt release exists, so public consumer acceptance is still unexecuted.

## Repair round 6 — independent review corrections, 2026-09-08

The next independent review found five defects in the prior repair. This round makes the publish
job install Vulkan and a checksum-validated Blender `5.2.0` before `release.ts --yes` runs its
registry verifier; the downstream clean-room job keeps its own identical prerequisites. The npm
workflow now calls `scripts/verify-native-release-commit.ts`, which peels the matching
`runtime-native-v<version>` tag and refuses a tag whose commit differs from `GITHUB_SHA`.

The immutable-version census now includes `package.json`, `src/`, templates, package metadata, and
every declared `files` input. A regression test changes only `core/gpl/LICENSE.GPL` and observes the
changed commit. The core package declares the aggregate `MIT AND GPL-2.0-or-later` SPDX expression,
ships its MIT `LICENSE`, and documents which bundled files are GPL.

The red controls were run before implementation:

```text
$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts \
    scripts/__tests__/verify-native-release-commit.spec.ts \
    scripts/__tests__/ci-structure.spec.ts -t \
    "counts a changed non-src publication input|native release commit guard|exact candidate commit|provisions the registry verifier"

Test Files  3 failed (3)
Tests       4 failed (4)
```

The green focused run after implementation:

```text
$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts \
    scripts/__tests__/verify-native-release-commit.spec.ts scripts/__tests__/ci-structure.spec.ts \
    scripts/__tests__/release.spec.ts scripts/__tests__/verify-registry-install.spec.ts \
    packages/core/__tests__/mcp-install.spec.ts scripts/__tests__/make-sandbox.spec.ts

Test Files  7 passed (7)
Tests       207 passed (207)
```

`pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm --filter @threenative/core build` also pass; the latter reaches
`publint` with `All good!`. At that point the top of this ledger identified repair round 6 as
current. The older Arm A version table and release observation are explicitly dated historical evidence, and
the unrelated `quiche-owned-v1` release is no longer described as a zero-release repository.

## Repair round 7 — post-rebase census and current evidence, 2026-09-08

Base: `5129de3204afdf7e3e443816fd905c6a8f9262af` (`origin/main`).
The source-census implementation under test is commit `c224461e9cca3e3154c31fb4164d5d49a9699faf`.
The pre-rebase round 4 records above remain historical; this section records the current base and
the outputs after the rebase.

### Build-input census: red, then green

Before the fix, a package whose build script changed only `tsup.config.ts` and
`scripts/build-helper.mjs` was reported unchanged:

```text
$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts -t "counts package-local build configs and helpers"

Test Files  1 failed (1)
Tests       1 failed | 41 skipped (42)
EXIT=1
```

The census now watches package-local `scripts/` directories, package-level `*.config.*` files, and
existing local files named by package scripts, in addition to the manifest, source, templates,
documents, and declared `files` inputs. The same regression is green, and the full publish-state
suite remains green:

```text
$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts -t "counts package-local build configs and helpers"
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests       1 passed | 41 skipped (42)
EXIT=0

$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests       42 passed (42)
EXIT=0
```

### Current publish preflight

```text

9 finding(s). This tree must not be published as it stands.
exit 1
```

The eight immutable versions and the missing native release are the expected external blocker;
the new census also catches build and lifecycle inputs before a coordinated publish can begin.

## Repair round 8 — coordinated release safety and complete build-input census, 2026-09-08

Base: `5129de3204afdf7e3e443816fd905c6a8f9262af` (`origin/main`). The code and regression tests
are committed as `8f06b8f3` (`fix: harden coordinated release preflight`).

This round closes the three remaining release-review findings. The guarded `--yes` path now
checks the exact candidate versions on npm as one cohort and refuses both a partially published
cohort and a cohort whose versions all already exist. It checks package cleanliness again after
`pnpm build`, then reruns `pnpm publish:check` before the first publish command. The source census
now includes package `tsconfig*.json`, root `tsconfig*.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the lockfile,
root package metadata, patches, package-local scripts, build configs and script-referenced files.

### Red controls before the repair

The new package-config tests initially showed that the old census saw no commits in those inputs:

```text
package tsconfig change: expected 1, received 0
shared tsconfig/catalog changes: expected 2, received 0
```

The release test also failed because the release module had no package-tree cleanliness helper to
call. These failures were fixed in the same code/test commit above.

### Green release and census suites

```text
$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts scripts/__tests__/release.spec.ts
Test Files  2 passed (2)
Tests       58 passed (58)
exit 0
```

The release suite now covers mixed, fully published and unreachable exact-version states, and
asserts that the post-build cleanliness and publish preflight checks precede publication. The
publish-state suite covers package-local and shared build inputs:

```text
$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/release.spec.ts
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests       14 passed (14)

$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests       44 passed (44)
```

### Cumulative verification at the lane tip

The workspace gates remain green after the repair. The full suite was run with the native package
excluded because this checkout has no built native executable or pump endpoint:

```text
$ TN_SUITE_EXCLUDE_PACKAGES='@threenative/runtime-native' pnpm test
Test Files  407 passed | 2 skipped (409)
Tests       4692 passed | 8 skipped (4700)
exit 0

$ pnpm typecheck
Scope: 28 of 29 workspace projects
exit 0

$ pnpm lint
Found 658 warnings.
exit 0

$ pnpm budgets

exit 0

$ pnpm quality
quality report: 139 findings (39 new, 29 grew, 49 inherited, 22 waived)
exit 0
```

The run left the worktree clean and `git diff --check` passed. The native package's own suite
still has the previously recorded 18 environment-dependent failures when invoked without its
compiled host; that lane is not claimed here.

### Current publish preflight after the repair

```text

exit 1
```

The code gates are now ready for an independent cumulative review. The external blocker remains:
prepare and commit a fresh coherent eleven-package version cohort, cut the matching native
release, and run the credentialed registry clean room.

### Repair round 8 continuation — final review corrections, 2026-09-08

The single cumulative review found two release-safety gaps. The publish job was invoking
`release.ts` without `--skip-gates`, which would rerun the full workspace suite on a runner that
does not build the native host. It now uses `--skip-gates` after the separate gates job has passed
the exact commit's native contract job; the release build, package cleanliness check, and
post-build `pnpm publish:check` still run in the publish job.

The publication-input census also missed sibling workspace packages whose files are copied into a
published artifact. It now resolves `workspace:` dependencies from the workspace manifests and
adds each referenced sibling package root to the source census. This covers the Blender GPL input
copied into `@threenative/assets` and both MCP bundles copied into `@threenative/core`.

### Red controls before the final repair

Both defects were reproduced before the implementation was restored:

```text
$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts \
    scripts/__tests__/ci-structure.spec.ts -t \
    "counts changes in a workspace sibling|reuses the already verified native CI result"
Test Files  2 failed (2)
Tests       2 failed | 126 skipped (128)
exit 1
  sibling census: expected 1, received 0
  workflow: expected release.ts --yes --skip-gates
```

### Green controls after the final repair

```text
$ pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/check-publish-state.spec.ts \
    scripts/__tests__/release.spec.ts scripts/__tests__/ci-structure.spec.ts
Test Files  3 passed (3)
Tests       142 passed (142)
exit 0
```

The full publish-state suite is 45/45, the release suite is 14/14, and the workflow structure
suite is 83/83. `git diff --check` is clean. This completes the review repair; the remaining
unverified boundaries are still the credentialed eleven-package publish, matching native release,
and consumer clean-room run described above.
