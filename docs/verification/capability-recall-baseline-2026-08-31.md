# Capability search recall — gated baseline, 2026-08-31

Recorded on 2026-09-05 from the clean PRD-297 checkout. The file name preserves the
baseline date used by the sealed brief. The gate reads the generated
packages/create-threenative/capabilities.json manifest (272 entries) and the same
manifest copied at packages/core/capabilities.json.

The sealed corpus has 58 rows:

- 46 mechanic bullets copied from the seven sealed genre briefs.
- 11 plain authoring requests.
- 1 animation-foot guard row used by the situation-tag mutation.

The 11 brief bullets that were zero-result in the historical baseline remain corpus
rows even when later manifest changes make a row return results. The budget also
records every currently recalled row, so a later ranking or tag change cannot
compensate for losing one query with a different query's gain.

The gate proof below is the historical predecessor measurement, preserved verbatim from
before the not-owned response migration. It counts only returned owned symbols: 25/58
recalled, 7/58 raw-empty, and 19 reject hits. It is not the current response-shape
measurement; the dated migration record below names what changed and which floors still
apply.

Misses (33)
- brief.endless-runner.3: Spawn an unbounded-feeling sequence of obstacles and collectibles with increasing pace.
- brief.endless-runner.5: Make a collision restart the run without a page reload.
- brief.exploration.1: Use a third-person camera and a compact hub that leads to at least two distinct areas. Name the starting area the literal `hub`; the proof compares `state.area` against that word.
- brief.exploration.3: Load or reveal a different arrangement of props in each area, with a clear transition.
- brief.exploration.4: Keep a journal or objective panel that records the inspected points of interest.
- brief.exploration.5: Make the world readable through deliberate lighting, landmarks, and a restrained palette.
- brief.fps.1: First person. Eye height 1.66 m, walking 5.6 m/s, sprinting 8.2 m/s while not aiming.
- brief.fps.2: Vertical field of view 70°, narrowing to 22° while aiming down the sights, and mouse look is half as sensitive while aimed. Pitch is clamped roughly −66° to +72°.
- brief.fps.3: Health starts at 100 and never regenerates. There is no jump, no crouch and no stamina.
- brief.fps.4: Spawns at the firing line facing down the range, with the nearest target on the crosshair.
- brief.fps.6: Magazine 30, reserve 90. Reload moves rounds from the reserve into the magazine; the sights drop for about 0.7 s while it happens.
- brief.fps.7: Hitscan along the exact camera forward axis out to 60 m. No spread, no bloom, no recoil kick, no damage falloff.
- brief.fps.8: 10 damage a round; 4× in the top 12% of a body's height, 0.7× below a third of it.
- brief.open-world.2: Stream or reveal terrain and content while the player travels across at least three chunk boundaries.
- brief.open-world.4: Include at least two landmarks or points of interest that are separated by the traversal.
- brief.open-world.5: Keep the first playable screen visible without a user account or external asset service.
- brief.physics-puzzle.3: Include one body class that the controlled character passes through and another that blocks the controlled character; make the distinction visible in the scene.
- brief.physics-puzzle.5: Run the same input sequence twice with a fixed seed and fixed-step simulation, and expose whether the final state matched on both runs.
- brief.physics-puzzle.6: Use an angled camera and a readable HUD so the controlled character, stack, pass-through body, and destination remain legible on the first screen.
- brief.platformer.2: Make the player run, jump, collect a visible line of coins, and reach a goal.
- brief.platformer.3: Include at least one raised platform, one gap, one enemy or hazard, and a restart path.
- brief.platformer.4: Match the reference's bright sky, saturated green platforms, warm wood, and rounded toy-like silhouettes.
- brief.topdown-action.3: Include three enemy targets, a short cooldown or reload feedback, and a win condition.
- brief.topdown-action.4: Build the arena from a few walls, floor markings, and pickups with a clear color hierarchy.

budget.json additionally stores the complete 58-row identity set as rowIds and the 25 recalled row IDs as recalledRows.

The build-and-chain proof was run as:

~~~sh
pnpm build && pnpm budgets
~~~

Observed output excerpts:

~~~text
capability manifest generated: 272 entries
Capability recall (58 rows)
zeroResultRate: 0.120690 (7/58)

MCP host configs current: 10 templates × 7 hosts
exit=0
~~~

## Integration proof

The caller census found the non-test consumer inside the pre-existing budgets chain:

~~~sh
$ grep -n "capability-recall" package.json
17:    "budgets": "... && tsx scripts/capability-recall.ts && ...",
19:    "caps:recall": "tsx scripts/capability-recall.ts",
~~~

The shipping check found no corpus content in either generated manifest:

~~~sh
$ grep -rn "endless runner\|firing line\|Magazine 30" packages/create-threenative/capabilities.json packages/core/capabilities.json
$ echo $?
1
~~~

The command produced no stdout. The corpus is read at gate time and is not copied
into a shipped artifact.

## Observed red controls

Each control was run against a temporary mutation and restored before the positive
gates and commit.

### Situation deletion

The real @situation stop a walking character's feet from sliding or spinning line
was deleted from packages/core/src/index.ts; pnpm build still completed and
regenerated the 272-entry manifest. The following gate then failed:

~~~text
Capability recall (58 rows)
zeroResultRate: 0.120690 (7/58)
recallAtK: 0.413793 (24/58)
rejectHits: 19
rowCount: 58

Regressions
- recallAtK: recallAtK 0.413793 is below floor 0.431034
- recalledRows: 1 previously recalled row no longer reaches an expected symbol
rows: guard.animation-feet
~~~

### Row-count floor

Deleting request.platformer-double-jump from the corpus produced:

~~~text
Capability recall (57 rows)
Regressions
- rowCount: rowCount 57 is below floor 58
rows: corpus
~~~

### Source-pointer resolution

Renaming the template:action-rpg#Start every change heading produced:

~~~text
TN_CAPABILITY_RECALL: guard.animation-feet: source 'template:action-rpg#Start every change renamed' no longer resolves
~~~

### Empty corpus

Replacing the corpus with a valid empty object produced:

~~~text
TN_CAPABILITY_RECALL: .../scripts/fixtures/capability-recall/corpus.json: corpus has no rows
~~~

The exit code was 1; it did not report a vacuous 100% recall.

### Stale manifest

Pointing THREENATIVE_CAPABILITIES_MANIFEST at a hand-written manifest with no
entries produced:

~~~text
TN_CAPABILITY_RECALL: brief.endless-runner.1: symbol 'defineGame' is absent from manifest .../scripts/fixtures/capability-recall/stale-manifest.json
~~~

The override was read and failed before any cached budget number could pass.

### Lowered zero-result floor

Temporarily changing budget.json's zeroResultRate floor from
0.1206896551724138 to 0 produced:

~~~text
Regressions
- zeroResultRate: zeroResultRate 0.120690 exceeds floor 0.000000
rows: brief.fps.3, request.tower-defense-game, request.inventory-system, request.third-person-camera, request.pick-up-item, request.multiplayer, request.platformer-double-jump
~~~

### Gate removal / revert check

Temporarily removing scripts/capability-recall.ts and running pnpm budgets
produced exit code 1 at the in-chain caller:

~~~text
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../scripts/capability-recall.ts'
~~~

The script was restored before the successful pnpm budgets run.

## Unit proof

~~~sh
pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/capability-recall.spec.ts
~~~

Observed: 1 test file passed, 9 tests passed.

The read-only candidate helper also runs:

~~~sh
pnpm caps:recall --harvest
~~~

Observed: Harvest candidates (115), exit code 0. It never edits
corpus.json or invents expected/rejected symbols.

## Migration measurement — 2026-09-05

PRD-298 now measures two valid answer paths. An owned capability symbol remains a
recalled answer, while a corpus-pinned `notOwned` response is actionable only when the
returned empty result carries the exact guidance from the generated manifest. The
historical predecessor's 25 recalled rows remain protected; the migration adds four
verified guidance rows without pretending they are owned symbols: 25 symbol hits + 4
verified guidance answers = 29 actionable rows out of 58.

The current measurement was read from the real gate:

~~~sh
pnpm caps:recall --json
~~~

The relevant observed JSON fields were:

~~~json
{
  "metrics": {
    "recallAtK": 0.43103448275862066,
    "recalled": 25,
    "rejectHits": 16,
    "rowCount": 58,
    "zeroResultRate": 0.1724137931034483,
    "zeroResults": 10,
    "unresolvedResultRate": 0.10344827586206896,
    "unresolvedResults": 6,
    "guided": 4,
    "actionable": 29
  },
  "budget": {
    "rowCount": 58,
    "recallAtK": 0.43103448275862066,
    "rejectHits": 19,
    "zeroResultRate": 0.1206896551724138,
    "unresolvedResultRate": 0.1206896551724138,
    "notOwnedRows": {
      "request.inventory-system": "inventory",
      "request.save-progress": "save-load",
      "request.dialogue-npc": "dialogue",
      "request.multiplayer": "networked-multiplayer"
    }
  },
  "regressions": []
}
~~~

The pinned values above were read directly from the budget file:

~~~sh
node --input-type=module -e 'import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises"; const b=JSON.parse(await readFile("scripts/fixtures/capability-recall/budget.json", "utf8")); console.log(JSON.stringify({rowCount:b.rowCount, rowIds:b.rowIds.length, recallAtK:b.recallAtK, recalledRows:b.recalledRows.length, rejectHits:b.rejectHits, zeroResultRate:b.zeroResultRate, unresolvedResultRate:b.unresolvedResultRate, notOwnedRows:b.notOwnedRows}, null, 2));'
~~~

That pin contains all 58 corpus identities, the 25 protected recalled-row IDs, and the
four row-to-`notOwned` IDs shown above. Its `rejectHits` ceiling remains 19, so the
current 16 is an improvement. Its 7/58 value is now the unresolved-answer ceiling:
`unresolvedResultRate` is 6/58 (0.103448), below 7/58 (0.120690). The budget retains
the predecessor `zeroResultRate` field at 7/58 for historical compatibility, but raw
zero results are informational and are no longer the acceptance metric.

The current raw zero count is 10/58 because all four guided answers intentionally have
an empty `results` array. Six other empty responses remain unsupported and unresolved;
they are what the 7/58 ceiling gates. The four verified expectations are `inventory`,
`save-load`, `dialogue`, and `networked-multiplayer`, mapped respectively by the four
corpus rows above. Losing their guidance is a dedicated failure: an empty array on a
pinned row must fail as `expected a verified not-owned response envelope`, and an
envelope whose guidance differs from the manifest must fail as
`not-owned response guidance does not match its manifest entry`.
