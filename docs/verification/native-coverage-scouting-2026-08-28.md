# Native C++ coverage — first measurement, 2026-08-28

**What this is:** a scouting run, not a gate. It exists because
[PRD-229](../PRDs/refactor-2026-08-28/PRD-229-the-native-host-is-provable-before-it-is-moved.md) plans a
coverage instrument for `packages/runtime-native` and a plan that names a baseline it has never
taken is a plan built on a guess. This run establishes that the toolchain works here, and what the
number is today. It is **not** the PRD's Phase 1 deliverable — there is no script, no gate, no
committed build option, and no negative control was exercised.

**Executed:** 2026-08-28 on this Linux workstation, repository at `7b729e2d`, working tree carrying
another lane's uncommitted `webgpu_compat.h` edit.

## How it was produced

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/tn-linux-coverage -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping -g -O0" \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-fprofile-instr-generate" \
  # remaining cache variables copied from the tn-linux preset
cmake --build build/tn-linux-coverage --target <25 threenative-*-test targets> -j 20
# each executable run with its own LLVM_PROFILE_FILE, then:
llvm-profdata merge -sparse prof/*.profraw -o merged.profdata
llvm-cov report <each executable as -object> -instr-profile=merged.profdata \
  -ignore-filename-regex='(third_party|\.runtime|/usr/|/opt/|sdl3-build)'
```

Toolchain: clang 22.1.8, `/usr/bin/llvm-cov`, `/usr/bin/llvm-profdata`. The shipping build is
unchanged — it still uses gcc 16.1.1 in `build/tn-linux`.

## What ran, and what did not

| Outcome | Count | Detail |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Test targets requested | 25 | every `threenative-*-test` in `CMakeLists.txt` |
| Built | 24 | — |
| **Failed to link** | 1 | `threenative-physics-actuation-bindings-test` — needs `TN_ENABLE_NATIVE_PHYSICS=ON`, which the `tn-linux` preset sets OFF |
| Ran and exited 0 | 21 | — |
| Skipped by their own contract | 1 | `threenative-handle-lifetime-test` exits `77` with `SKIP: quickjs is not compiled in` — a skip encoded as an exit code, invisible to any runner that only checks for zero |
| Not invokable bare | 1 | `threenative-shutdown-lifetime-test` prints `usage: … http \| timer-watch <path>` — it takes an argument the vitest wrapper supplies; this run did not |
| **Failed** | 1 | `threenative-render-pass-class-table-test` — see below |

### Correction: the render-pass failure was a stale-binary comparison, not a configuration difference

```
FAIL: render pass methods are prototype members, not per-instance own properties
FAIL: render pass method identities are shared across instances
FAIL: detached end() reports the missing receiver by name, got: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
render-pass-class-table contract: 3 failure(s)
```

The originally compared `build/tn-linux` executable exited `0`, but it was stale: the executable
was linked on 2026-08-27 while `bindings.cpp.o` had been rebuilt on 2026-08-28. Four clean builds
(gcc/clang × Debug/Release) all produced the same three failures. A clean build at the exact
scouting commit, `7b729e2d`, did too.

`git bisect` between `47d1adb3` and `7b729e2d` identified `fa72e6b3` (`replay packed WebGPU frame
streams`) as the first bad commit. The packed-stream runtime script replaced render- and
compute-pass wrappers with object literals carrying per-instance arrow methods. The existing C++
contract correctly detected the regression once rebuilt.

The prerequisite repair and its red-green proof are recorded in
[native-class-table-baseline-repair-2026-08-28](./native-class-table-baseline-repair-2026-08-28.md).
The coverage compiler and optimization level are therefore not implicated.

## The number

**39.19% of instrumented executable lines in the `tn-linux` configuration**, from 24 executables.

Read the denominator carefully: `llvm-cov` counts *executable lines that were compiled into these
binaries*, which is 18,541 — not the 40,385 physical lines in `src/`. The gap is mostly
configuration: `TN_ENABLE_RAYTRACING`, `TN_ENABLE_VIDEO`, `TN_ENABLE_DEBUG_SERVER`,
`TN_ENABLE_NATIVE_GLTF` and `TN_ENABLE_NATIVE_PHYSICS` are all OFF in this preset, so
`src/video/` (2,139 physical lines), `src/debug/` (739), `src/gltf/` (475) and most of
`src/raytracing/` (5,014) are **not compiled at all** and appear nowhere below. They are not
0%-covered; they are unmeasured.

### Per subsystem

| Subsystem | Instrumented lines | Covered | Line % | Functions | Function % |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `src/webgpu/` | 7,174 | 2,423 | **33.77%** | 304 | 40.79% |
| `src/js/` | 2,665 | 1,052 | 39.47% | 166 | 56.02% |
| `src/runtime.cpp` | 2,583 | 1,303 | 50.45% | 143 | 39.86% |
| `src/canvas/` | 1,357 | 815 | 60.06% | 98 | 40.82% |
| `src/audio/` | 1,283 | 727 | 56.66% | 112 | 60.71% |
| `src/platform/` | 945 | 207 | 21.90% | 80 | 45.00% |
| `src/webtransport/` | 818 | 81 | **9.90%** | 42 | 9.52% |
| `src/raytracing/` (bindings only) | 506 | 90 | 17.79% | 47 | 17.02% |
| `src/http/` | 400 | 51 | 12.75% | 30 | 23.33% |
| `src/storage/` | 261 | 226 | 86.59% | 21 | 95.24% |
| `src/vfs/` | 239 | 175 | 73.22% | 15 | 86.67% |
| `src/fs/` | 232 | 59 | 25.43% | 23 | 52.17% |
| `src/async/` | 78 | 58 | 74.36% | 10 | 90.00% |
| **TOTAL** | **18,541** | **7,267** | **39.19%** | **1,091** | **45.00%** |

### The files PRD-229 is about

| File | Instrumented lines | Covered | Line % |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `src/webgpu/bindings.cpp` | 5,806 | 1,866 | **32.14%** |
| `src/webgpu/context.cpp` | 799 | 161 | 20.15% |
| `src/webgpu/registration_table.cpp` | 394 | 328 | 83.25% |
| `src/webgpu/wrapper_factories.cpp` | 143 | 36 | 25.17% |
| `src/webgpu/checked_handle.cpp` | 22 | 22 | 100.00% |
| `src/runtime.cpp` | 2,583 | 1,303 | 50.45% |

### Zero and near-zero, worth naming

| File | Instrumented lines | Line % |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `src/http/http_client.cpp` | 106 | **0.00%** |
| `src/js/ts_transpiler.cpp` | 46 | **0.00%** |
| `src/platform/window.cpp` | 158 | **0.00%** |
| `src/js/module_resolver.cpp` | 804 | 0.50% |
| `src/js/module_system.cpp` | 505 | 2.18% |
| `src/platform/input.cpp` | 518 | 4.44% |
| `src/webtransport/webtransport.cpp` | 818 | 9.90% |

`src/js/module_resolver.cpp` at 0.50% includes a 218-line hand-written JSON parser
(`parseJsonValue`). `src/platform/window.cpp` and `src/platform/input.cpp` are near-zero because
these executables are headless contract tests that open no window — which is a fair reason and
still leaves the code unproven.

## What this run does not claim

- **No gate ran.** `pnpm budgets`, `pnpm quality` and the vitest suite were not re-run against
  this build.
- **No negative control was exercised.** Every number here is a first observation with nothing
  proving the instrument can go red. PRD-229 Phase 1 owes those controls.
- **No device, Android, iOS or Windows result.** Linux desktop only.
- **The `tn-linux-quickjs` configuration was not measured**, so the QuickJS engine paths are
  unrepresented, and `threenative-handle-lifetime-test` skipped itself for exactly that reason.

## Artifacts

`build/tn-linux-coverage/` is untracked, like every other build directory. The merged profile and
the raw `llvm-cov` report live in this session's scratch directory and are not committed; the
command block above reproduces them.
