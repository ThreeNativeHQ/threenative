# PRD-267 — the starter scaffold fails its own tests

**Status:** CLOSED WITH LOCAL EVIDENCE, 2026-08-31.** The audit now covers both shipped playtest
roots and all eight scaffolded template matrices pass locally. Golden-path CI and A2 release
evidence were not reproduced in this run; the executed scope and remaining evidence boundary are
recorded in [`starter-kit Linchpin evidence`](../../../verification/starter-kits-linchpin-resume-2026-08-31.md).

**Goal: a stranger who scaffolds a project and runs `npm test` sees it pass.**
Today they see a wall of failures, and they see it on the default template.

## The measurement

`golden-path` scaffolds a starter from workspace tarballs and runs the project's own playtests. It
fails. Reproduced locally against a scaffolded starter on an RTX 2080 with a real display, so this
is not CI's rasteriser:

```text
     19 TN_PLAYTEST_RESOURCE_ASSERTION_FAILED
     11 TN_PLAYTEST_VISIBILITY_FAILED
      4 TN_PLAYTEST_MOVEMENT_ASSERTION_FAILED
      3 TN_PLAYTEST_RESOURCE_TRANSITION_ASSERTION_FAILED
      1 TN_PLAYTEST_AXIS_DELTA_ASSERTION_FAILED
      1 TN_PLAYTEST_PATH_LENGTH_ASSERTION_FAILED
      1 TN_PLAYTEST_POSITION_REACH_ASSERTION_FAILED
```

with messages of the form *"Observed resource value did not change during the scenario"*. Nothing
moves, nothing scores, and the goal flag is not on screen.

Run with and without `--no-screenshots`: **identical counts**, so the flag added for golden-path is
not the cause and is exonerated by control rather than by argument.

## The cause

The starter boots to its main menu — `start: "menu"` in `game.ts`, with a name field and a `begin`
submit. **Three of its twenty-one scenarios press that button**; `zoom-pinch`, `zoom-wheel` and
`menu-flow` carry a `start-game` step. The other eighteen open the game and immediately press
`ArrowRight`, expecting a player that does not exist yet:

```json
{ "kind": "input", "label": "run-up", "press": "ArrowRight", "holdTicks": 205, "release": false }
```

The repository's own `playtests/starter-look.playtest.json` shows what the others are missing — it
waits for the menu, clicks the name field, types a name, and clicks start before doing anything
else — and it passes.

This is the same defect that broke the hot-reload proof
([PRD-266](../performance/PRD-266-the-hot-reload-proof-and-the-browser-lane-run-anywhere.md) §1's neighbour): the
menu screen flow landed in [PRD-218](../done/batch-2026-08-24-menu-screen-flow/PRD-218-scene-screens-and-menu-flow.md),
three scenarios were updated, and the rest were not.

## What the per-scenario summary bought

The batch runner printed one JSON document at the end, and CI's log viewer truncated it — a failing
run showed `"pass": false` with only the first scenario readable, and that scenario had passed. The
runner now writes a line per scenario as it finishes, and the next run named the failure
immediately:

```text
{"scenarioSummary":{"diagnostics":["TN_PLAYTEST_PERFORMANCE_ASSERTION_FAILED"],
 "failed":["performance.maxFrameMsP95"],"pass":false,"scenario":"play"}}
```

That one line replaced a whole diagnostic cycle, and it is what turned "golden-path is red" into
"fifteen of sixteen pass and the sixteenth wants 30fps from a machine with no GPU".

## §3 — `platformer-stomp`, the last red

What is measured, on a scaffolded platformer:

- **It passes on hardware.** `stomp.playtest.json` run headed against an RTX 2080 exits `0`.
- **It fails on CI**, whose runner has no GPU, on `resource.state.defeated` (stagnated) and
  `tags.patrol`.
- **It is not the menu.** This template boots to `boot`, not to a menu with a form, so the cause
  that explained the starter's eighteen scenarios does not apply.
- **It is not the level failing to load.** `tags.patrol` was *evaluated* and disagreed, which means
  patrol entities existed to be counted. A level that never arrived would have failed differently.

**It is not the frame rate, and the tick counts prove it.** The per-scenario summary carries the
first tick, the last tick and the frame count, so the three runs can be laid side by side:

| Run | firstTick | lastTick | span | frames | result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware (RTX 2080) | 27 | 144 | **117** | **115** | pass |
| CI, run 33317257682 | 48 | 165 | **117** | **115** | **pass** |
| CI, run on `3672e04e` | 63 | 180 | **117** | **115** | **fail** |

The fixed-step loop ran the same number of ticks over the same number of frames every time. The
only thing that moved is the starting offset — how many ticks were consumed before the first step,
which is boot time and nothing else.

So **the same 117 ticks land the stomp or miss it, run to run, on the same machine.** That is not a
slow rasteriser and it is not a timing budget. It is a fixed-step scenario producing different
physics outcomes from an identical number of steps, which means something in the path is not
deterministic — a starting position, a patrol phase seeded off wall-clock, or a physics substep
that reads real time. `platformer-stomp-rise` fails the same way in the same run.

That is the thing to find, and it is worth more than this scenario: a playtest harness whose
fixed-step runs are not reproducible cannot prove a regression from a green run. Look for the
non-determinism, not for a longer wait — padding a flaky scenario hides exactly the property that
makes the harness trustworthy.

## Why it was invisible

Three gates should have caught it and none could. CI had never completed a run, so `golden-path`
never executed. `pnpm test:templates` aborts at the first failing template, and the shooter fails
before the starter is reached — so the default template is never tested. And **A2 on the alpha bar
passes against `create-threenative@0.2.2`**, whose templates predate the menu.

The alpha bar's golden-path row is green for a version of the scaffold nobody is shipping.

## What is left: movement measured across a run that starts before the player exists

`starter-assets` is the one scenario still red, on `movement.minDistance`. Its state proves the
player moved — `playerX` goes `-2` to `6.999`, `status` reaches `won` — while the movement
assertion reports nothing:

```text
Entity 'player' was not observed in both samples, so its movement was never measured —
the run reports no distance rather than a distance of zero.
```

That message is new, and it is the second fix in `6e327a7f`: `distance` falls back to `0` when the
entity is missing from a snapshot, and `minDistance` used to read that fallback as a measurement,
reporting `moved 0.000000` for a player who was never there. `maxDistance` already refused to,
with a comment explaining exactly this hazard. Now both refuse, and the message says which of the
two happened.

The underlying limitation: a **named** movement entity is measured between the run's first and last
snapshot, and the first is taken after warmup — on the menu, where there is no player. Per-step
sampling exists but only for *anonymous* movement scenarios, and dropping `entity` does not help
either, because those samples still span the menu steps.

Three ways out, none of them "delete the assertion":

1. **Measure a named entity from its first observation to its last.** The plain reading of "the
   player moved at least 0.5 during this run", and it needs the runner to sample a named entity
   per step the way it already does for anonymous ones.
2. **Let a scenario scope movement to a step interval** — `movement.from`/`movement.to` by label,
   next to the labels `atSteps` already uses.
3. **Warm up into the game**, so the first snapshot is taken after the menu. Smallest change,
   and it makes every scenario's first sample mean something different depending on its steps.

## The decision this PRD has to make

Not *whether* to fix it, but how a scenario should reach the play scene:

1. **Every scenario clicks through the menu**, as `starter-look` does. Honest, and eighteen files
   repeat five steps that have nothing to do with what each one proves.
2. **A scenario declares the scene it starts in** — a `setup.scene` beside the existing
   `setup.spawn` and `setup.aim`. One line per scenario, and the harness owns the transition. Does
   not prove the menu works, which is what `menu-flow` is for.
3. **The template's scenarios are rewritten around the menu** as a real part of the game.

Option 2 is the smallest change per scenario and the one that scales to every template that grows a
menu. It is also new harness surface, which is why this is a decision and not a patch.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] A freshly scaffolded starter passes its non-visual scenarios with no edits — 14 of 14 on CI
      and exit 0 cold on a developer machine. The seven left out are the ones that need hardware:
      screenshots, baselines, a `visual` assertion, or a frame-time budget.
- [ ] The **platformer** finishes too. It is one scenario short — `platformer-stomp` — and what is
      known about it is in §3 below.
- [ ] `pnpm test:templates` does not abort at the first failing template — every template reports,
      so the default one can never be silently untested again.
- [ ] `golden-path` is green on CI.
- [ ] The same audit is run against every other template, and the count of scenarios that assume
      they start in play is recorded per template rather than assumed to be zero.
- [ ] A2's evidence is re-taken against the version actually being shipped, not `0.2.2`.
