# PRD-279 — geometry the camera cannot resolve is never submitted

**Status: DONE — the design held, 2026-08-30. Filed against `80254bd0`; the batch it opened is
closed in [its README](../../nanite-like/README.md).** Every kill gate below was run rather than argued. The two
decisions this file exists to make both survived contact:

- **No visibility buffer.** The game's own material draws every cluster, on browser and on native.
  Nothing in `packages/core/src/clustered-mesh.ts` or `clustered-batch.ts` constructs a material, a
  light or a colour, and `constraints.spec.ts` holds that. The cost this file predicted is visible
  in the numbers — the win is 5.4× against `dense` rather than the order of magnitude the published
  implementations report — and it is what makes the feature admissible here.
- **One indexed draw per material batch, never one per cluster.** That held, and then the instrument
  made it cost something: 396 instanced boulders needed one cut per *distance group* rather than one
  per mesh, so the frame issues 89 draws instead of 10. On browser that is a good trade and on
  native it is not, which is the batch's open regression.

**One correction §3 earned.** It said multi-draw indirect *"does not exist on this stack"*. The
measuring machine's adapter reports `chromium-experimental-multi-draw-indirect`. It is a Chromium
experiment with no counterpart on the owned native runtime, so the design decision is unchanged and
the row means *not portably available* — which is what it always meant.

**Goal: a game imports a mesh far denser than the screen can resolve, and the frame submits only
the clusters that resolve — on web and on native, from the same source, with the game's own
material still doing the shading.** The user-facing surface is one key in the asset config, set once
at bake time — not a second renderer, not a runtime switch, and not a second way to author a scene.

**Complexity:** +2 a new subsystem that spans the offline pipeline and the per-frame hot path,
+2 a new on-disk payload, +2 GPU-driven submission inside a frame this repository has already
measured and tuned, +1 four packages (`assets`, `core`, `create-threenative`, `runtime-native`),
+1 a native lane with one binding known to be missing, +1 an integration against three.js's node
material system that the mined references all solve by owning the shading path this framework may
not own = **9 → HIGH mode.**

**This is the batch's design document.** It holds the charter argument, the verified state of this
repository, the sources and their licences, and the risks. The execution is six sibling PRDs
indexed in [README.md](../../nanite-like/README.md), each owning one phase and its decline condition.

Sibling context: the [feature-mining batch](../../feature-mining/README.md), whose correction about
`GPUParticles3D` — *mechanism is not the look* — is the rule this PRD lives or dies by.

## 1. Why this is proposed at all

The framework's public surface has **194 capability entries**
(`packages/create-threenative/capabilities.json`) and **not one of them is a level of detail, a
cluster, or a per-triangle culler**. The only culling that ships decides per *object*: the render
projection's frustum pass, landed by [PRD-238](../PRD-238-the-projection-culls-what-the-camera-cannot-see.md),
removes sub-draws whose whole object is off screen. A single 2-million-triangle asset in view is
therefore submitted whole, every frame, at every distance.

The offline half is equally whole-mesh: `packages/assets/src/passes/model.ts` runs one
`simplify` at one ratio for the entire model (`model.ts:11-12`), a decision taken once, with no
camera, for all viewing distances at once. Its own report already admits when the error tolerance
stopped it short (`packages/assets/src/report.ts:83-87`).

So today a game that wants scanned or sculpted geometry has exactly two options, and both are the
game's problem: author discrete LODs by hand and switch them with `THREE.LOD`, or decimate once in
the pipeline and accept the loss up close.

**What is not known, and is what Phase 0 exists to find out:** none of the above has been priced.
This repository has no measurement of what a dense static asset costs in its own frame, on either
target. The nearest neighbouring facts it does hold are that WebGPU unrolls a `BatchedMesh` into
one `drawIndexed` per sub-draw
(`docs/verification/prd-152-transparent-scene-optimization-2026-08-18.md:110`), and that on the
native Pixel 8 lane the owner's bar is 60 fps and the frame ledger lives in
`docs/verification/runtime-perf-state.md`. A PRD this size does not open on an intuition.

## 2. The charter question, answered before the design

**(a) Could the game write this portably itself?** No. It needs storage buffers, a compute
dispatch, an indirect draw buffer, and a bake step that runs in the asset pipeline. Every one of
those is a seam the framework already owns and the game must not learn.

**(b) Does it decide how anything looks?** It must not — and this is the single constraint that
shapes the entire design. **Every mined reference answers "yes" here.** Nyx, Vulcanite,
nanite-at-home and `nanite-webgpu` all render into a *visibility buffer* and then resolve
materials in a full-screen pass. That pass is the shading path. Adopting it would mean this
framework decides how lighting, tonemapping and material evaluation happen for any virtualized
mesh — a rule-3 veto, and rule 3 outranks rule (a).

**The v1 design therefore drops the visibility buffer**, and keeps the game's own `NodeMaterial`
drawing the selected clusters through three.js's ordinary path. This costs performance relative to
the references and buys the only thing that makes the feature admissible here. It is stated up
front because it is the decision most likely to be argued with later.

The test that must stay answerable *yes* at every phase: **can the game change the appearance
completely without editing framework code?** In v1 it can, because the framework never constructs
a material.

**Where it goes, and no new package.** A package exists only when it carries a dependency the
others must not inherit, and nothing here does: the baker lands in `packages/assets`, which
already depends on `meshoptimizer` (`packages/assets/package.json:43`) and `@gltf-transform`; the
runtime lands in `packages/core` and imports nothing but `three`. **If the runtime ever needs
`meshoptimizer` at run time, that is a signal to stop and re-scope, not a dependency to add.**

**And it is not a scene format.** A scene format is closed with evidence and outranks rule 1. What
this emits is a per-mesh geometry payload written *into the `.glb` the pipeline already produces*,
as a glTF extension — `TN_virtual_geometry` — detected by the same seam that already lazily wires
the meshopt and Draco decoders off `extensionsUsed` (`packages/core/src/assets.ts:196-215`).
Nobody authors it, nobody reads it by hand, and no new file type appears in a game's repository.
If the design cannot stay inside that constraint, that is itself a decline condition.

## 3. What this repository already has — verified against `HEAD`

| Piece | Where | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `meshoptimizer` 1.1.1, in the pipeline | `packages/assets/package.json:43`, used at `passes/model.ts:11-12` | **already a dependency** |
| Meshlet construction and cluster bounds | `meshopt_clusterizer.d.ts`: `buildMeshlets`, `buildMeshletsFlex`, `buildMeshletsSpatial`, `computeMeshletBounds`, `computeClusterBounds` | **ships in the installed JS build** |
| Boundary-locked simplification | `meshopt_simplifier.d.ts`: `simplifyWithAttributes(..., vertex_lock, ...)`, `LockBorder` flag | **ships** — this is what the DAG's group-locked simplify needs |
| **Cluster partitioning** | — | **missing from the JS binding.** No `partitionClusters` anywhere in `meshopt_clusterizer.js`; the README's Clusterizer section documents build/extract/bounds only. This is the one algorithm the DAG cannot be built without |
| Indirect draw from three.js | three `0.185.1` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml:4`): `IndirectStorageBufferAttribute` (15 references in `three.webgpu.js`), `geometry.indirect` → `drawIndirect`/`drawIndexedIndirect` | **available, unpatched** |
| Indirect compute dispatch from three.js | `three.webgpu.js:85352` `dispatchWorkgroupsIndirect` | available |
| Indirect draw on native | `bindings_commands.cpp:1255-1261` and `:1522-1527`; frame-stream opcodes 10/11 at `bindings_frame_stream.cpp:107,241`; `GPUBufferUsage.INDIRECT` at `bindings.cpp:2635`; usage attribution at `bindings_resources.cpp:122` | **bound on both native paths** |
| **Indirect compute dispatch on native** | frame-stream opcode table names `compute.setPipeline`, `compute.setBindGroup`, `compute.dispatchWorkgroups`, `compute.end` — and no indirect form (`bindings_frame_stream.cpp:107`) | **missing.** Either a binding to add, or the dispatch count stays CPU-side |
| Multi-draw indirect | — | **not portably available.** WebGPU unrolls a batch into one `drawIndexed` per sub-draw (`prd-152…:110`). Chromium exposes `chromium-experimental-multi-draw-indirect` on this machine's adapter (observed 2026-08-30 in `artifacts/quarry/dense/capture.json`), but it is a browser experiment with no counterpart on the owned native runtime, so nothing in this batch may depend on it. The design must produce *one* indirect draw per material batch, never one per cluster |
| A per-frame compute lifecycle to attach to | `ComputeDrivenRegistry`, `packages/core/src/compute-driven.ts` — warmup, `process` at a declared cadence, release | **exists; nothing new is needed in the loop** |
| Precedent for packing a scene into TSL storage | `packages/core/src/gpu-scene-bvh.ts` | exists |
| The "must beat doing nothing" discipline | `projection-plan.ts` — `MIN_BATCH_MEMBERS`, the kill-switch ratio, and the black-screen incident it was written for | the same gate applies here |

The two rows in bold are the project's real unknowns, and they are what Phase 0 and Phase 1 are
sized around.

## 4. What is mined, from where, and under what licence

**Unverified as of filing.** The repository rule is that a claim about an upstream source is cited
by file and line against a depth-1 clone read on a stated date. None of the rows below have been.
Phase 0 does the cloning and either confirms each row or strikes it.

| Source | Licence | What would be taken |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zeux/meshoptimizer` | MIT | Already installed. Meshlets, bounds, locked simplification; and the C++ `demo/clusterlod.h` as the **algorithm** for group → simplify → re-cluster, since that header is not in the JS binding |
| `Scthe/nanite-webgpu` | MIT | Closest stack match — TypeScript + WGSL. LOD-selection and cull kernels, and its preprocessed layout, as reference |
| `moonlovelj/Nyx` | MIT | Streaming: fixed-size pages, GPU request feedback, residency/address table, eviction. Phase 5 only |
| `zeux/niagara` | MIT | GPU-driven submission shape: instance cull → cluster cull → depth pyramid |
| `bdwhst/Vulcanite` | MIT | DAG builder and GPU traversal as pseudocode |
| `Firestar99/nanite-at-home` | MIT | The baker/runtime/disk/GPU separation, when fixing what `TN_virtual_geometry` holds |
| `AIFanatic/three-nanite` | MIT | three.js integration details only; its own README calls it a start |
| `Unity-Technologies/com.unity.virtualmesh` | **Unity Companion License** | **Read for architecture. No code, no shader, no constant, no structure copied.** Anyone who opens it says so in the commit message |

Vendored MIT code keeps its copyright header and is listed in the licence manifest; a port that
follows a source closely enough to be a derivative is treated as vendored, not as inspiration.

## 5. The shape of v1

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[glTF / GLB source] --> B[assets pipeline]
  B --> C[cluster the mesh into meshlets]
  C --> D[group clusters]
  D --> E[simplify each group with locked boundaries]
  E --> F[re-cluster the simplified group]
  F --> G{coarse enough?}
  G -- no --> D
  G -- yes --> H[DAG with monotonic error bounds]
  H --> I[TN_virtual_geometry inside the same .glb]
  I --> J[core loader: clusters, bounds, error, parents]
  J --> K[per frame: select the DAG cut for this camera]
  K --> L[frustum and backface cone reject]
  L --> M[write index ranges + one indirect draw arg]
  M --> N[the game's own NodeMaterial draws it]
  N --> O[the ordinary three.js render path, lights, shadows, post]
```

The selection rule is the standard one and is the whole correctness argument: a cluster is drawn
when **its own screen-space error is under the threshold and its parent group's error is not**. If
the error stored through the DAG is monotonic — a parent never claims less error than any child —
then that rule picks a cut with no cracks, for any camera, without any neighbour communication.
That invariant is testable offline, in `vitest`, with no GPU, and it is the first thing to test.

**Out of v1, explicitly:** software rasterization of sub-pixel triangles, the visibility buffer and
its material resolve, impostors, skinned and morphed geometry, alpha-tested foliage, streaming
(Phase 5 at the earliest), and shadow passes driven by their own cut. **Shadows draw one coarse cut,
fixed at load** — a cut per shadow camera doubles the selection cost for detail nobody resolves in a
shadow, and handing the game a proxy to maintain pushes back the work this batch promised to take.
It is a stated quality limit, and the visual comparison measures it instead of assuming it away.

## 6. The phases, and the PRD that owns each

Every phase is a separate PRD in this folder, and each one names the condition that ends the whole
batch rather than just itself. Nothing downstream is written until the phase above it is green.

| Phase | PRD | Ends the batch if |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — the instrument and the price | [PRD-280 — the quarry is the instrument](./PRD-280-the-quarry-is-the-instrument.md) | The dense arm is not meaningfully more expensive than the decimated one |
| 1 — the bake | [PRD-281 — a dense mesh bakes to a crack-free cluster DAG](./PRD-281-a-dense-mesh-bakes-to-a-crack-free-cluster-dag.md) | Partitioning needs a native build step in the asset pipeline, or the error bounds cannot be made monotonic |
| 2 — the cut, on the CPU | [PRD-282 — the cut is chosen on the CPU first](./PRD-282-the-cut-is-chosen-on-the-cpu-first.md) | The selected cut cannot beat drawing the source mesh whole |
| 3 — the cut, on the GPU, on both targets | [PRD-283 — the cut moves to the GPU and native runs it](../../nanite-like/PRD-283-the-cut-moves-to-the-gpu-and-native-runs-it.md) | The kernel cannot match the CPU oracle, or native cannot run it |
| 4 — occlusion | [PRD-284 — the frame does not draw what the frame already hid](./PRD-284-the-frame-does-not-draw-what-the-frame-already-hid.md) | Nothing: this phase declines alone |
| 5 — streaming | [PRD-285 — clusters arrive when the camera asks for them](./PRD-285-clusters-arrive-when-the-camera-asks-for-them.md) | Nothing: this phase declines alone |

## 7. The kill switch

Scored with `pnpm tsx scripts/count-loc.ts`, against the honest alternative: a game that hand-authors
three discrete LODs and switches them with `THREE.LOD`.

| | Lines |
| --- | --- |
| Baker in `packages/assets` | to be measured at Phase 1 |
| Runtime in `packages/core` | to be measured at Phase 2 |
| Hand-written equivalent, per game | three authored LODs + a switch, per asset |
| Caller delta, `examples/engine-load-test` | to be measured |

The threshold is stated now so it cannot be moved later: **if the caller does not get shorter and
the frame does not get faster, the whole thing is deleted**, however much of it exists. A feature
of this size that only breaks even is worse than nothing, because every future change pays for it.

## 8. Acceptance criteria

Unchecked, and several are conditional on the phase before them surviving its gate.

- [x] **AC0 — the problem has a number.** Owned by [PRD-280](./PRD-280-the-quarry-is-the-instrument.md):
      the measurement is in `docs/verification/`, naming both targets, with the decline threshold
      evaluated in writing.
- [ ] **AC1 — the sources are read, not cited from memory.** §4 carries file-and-line citations
      against depth-1 clones, dated, and any row that does not survive is struck rather than
      quietly softened. This one belongs to this PRD and is its only unblocked work.
- [ ] **AC2 — the DAG has no cracks.** ([PRD-281](./PRD-281-a-dense-mesh-bakes-to-a-crack-free-cluster-dag.md)) A test picks cuts at many error thresholds on a real asset
      and asserts every boundary edge is shared by exactly two selected triangles.
- [ ] **AC3 — red-green, monotonic error.** Removing the parent-error `max` propagation in the
      baker fails AC2's test with a named hole count, and that failure is pasted.
- [ ] **AC4 — red-green, the empty cut.** A camera that resolves nothing produces zero submitted
      clusters and no draw, not a zero-count indirect draw that draws nothing and warns nothing —
      the failure mode `projection-apply.ts:146` already records for `InstancedMesh`.
- [ ] **AC5 — compute matches the CPU oracle.** ([PRD-283](../../nanite-like/PRD-283-the-cut-moves-to-the-gpu-and-native-runs-it.md)) For a fixed camera set, the Phase 3 kernel selects
      the same cluster set as the Phase 2 walk, exactly.
- [ ] **AC6 — it originates no appearance.** `packages/core/__tests__/constraints.spec.ts` asserts
      the module constructs no material, light or colour and contains no hex literal, on the same
      terms as `tracers.ts` and `instanced-batch.ts`.
- [ ] **AC7 — the game still owns the look.** A test swaps the material on a virtualized mesh and
      asserts the swapped material is what draws; no framework shader participates.
- [ ] **AC8 — a named caller.** ([PRD-280](./PRD-280-the-quarry-is-the-instrument.md)) `examples/engine-load-test` with the dense rung, and a playtest
      scenario that asserts the frame result, not that the code ran.
- [ ] **AC9 — native.** A `--target desktop` playtest in the same commit as Phase 3, with
      `adapter.info` named. Android and iOS may be `UNVERIFIED`, and must say so.
- [ ] **AC10 — discoverable.** `capabilities.json` regenerated, the new entry findable by the plain
      words a game would use — *"a model too detailed to draw"* — and `check-capability-docs.ts`
      clean.

## 9. Risks, in the order they are likely to bite

1. **No multi-draw indirect.** Every reference implementation submits thousands of clusters in one
   command. This stack cannot, so the win has to come from *not submitting* geometry rather than
   from cheap submission. If per-material indirect draws leave the frame no better, Phase 2's gate
   catches it — that gate is the point.
2. **Dropping the visibility buffer costs most of the published speedups.** Accepted deliberately.
   The alternative is owning the shading path, which is not available here.
3. **The bake is slow.** A full DAG on a large asset is minutes, and the pipeline runs in CI. It
   caches by content hash or it does not ship.
4. **Second-hand claims.** §4 is the weakest part of this file today and is Phase 0's first job.
5. **The pull toward v2.** Streaming, impostors and software raster are the interesting parts, and
   each of them re-opens rule 3. They stay out until a game in this repository needs them.
