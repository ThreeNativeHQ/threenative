# ThreeNative UE5-Class Feature Checklists & Repository Reuse Scan

**Version:** 2.0 — numbered feature checklists + repository reuse scan  
**Research snapshot:** 2026-08-30  
**Audience:** ThreeNative renderer, runtime, tooling, asset-pipeline, QA, and platform engineers  
**Purpose:** Provide an implementation-ready, numbered checklist for every Unreal Engine 5–inspired ThreeNative subsystem and identify open-source repositories that can be adopted, forked, ported, or mined to accelerate delivery. Features remain ordered by expected strategic impact relative to engineering effort.

> This document defines **outcome parity**, not source-code or implementation parity with Unreal Engine. Each feature begins with a numbered completion checklist. Its repository scan then identifies reusable implementation seeds; finding a repo never waives the checklist or turns a prototype into a production subsystem.

The Unreal feature names in this document are comparison labels. Public ThreeNative names should remain engine-specific—for example, `DynamicGI`, `VirtualGeometry`, `VirtualShadows`, and `TemporalUpscaler`—and should not imply binary compatibility with Unreal Engine.

## Navigation

**Core gates:** [Decision rule](#1-the-decision-rule) · [Capability tiers](#2-baseline-architecture-and-capability-tiers) · [Global Definition of Done](#3-global-definition-of-done) · [Benchmark manifest](#4-benchmark-manifest-required-for-every-stable-feature) · [Dependency map](#5-shared-dependency-map) · [Effort-impact matrix](#6-effort-impact-priority-matrix)

Feature definitions are physically ordered by the ranking below. Existing `F#` labels and requirement IDs remain stable so issue links and implementation references do not break.

## 1. The decision rule

A feature is **Done** only when all of the following are true:

1. Every applicable requirement in the **Global Definition of Done** is checked.
2. Every mandatory checkbox in that feature's section is checked.
3. Every promised capability tier and platform passes the feature's conformance suite.
4. The canonical demo is reproducible from a clean checkout and contains no private assets or manual setup.
5. Performance, memory, image quality, lifecycle, and degraded-mode evidence is attached to the release record.
6. Known exclusions are represented by explicit capability flags and documentation—not by silent failure.
7. The public API is marked `stable`; an attractive prototype, research branch, example, or editor-only effect is not sufficient.

### Maturity labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Research** | Algorithm exploration. Breaking changes and curated-scene assumptions are expected. |
| **Experimental** | Publicly callable, but unsupported combinations and performance cliffs remain. |
| **Beta** | API mostly stable; broad test coverage exists; production risks are documented. |
| **Stable / Done** | All mandatory requirements and evidence gates in this document pass. |
| **Parity extension** | Additional UE-like depth that is useful but not necessary for the first Stable release. |

### Requirement language

- Every unqualified checkbox is a **MUST** for Done.
- `[PARITY]` checkboxes are excluded from the first Stable closure gate unless ThreeNative publicly promises them.
- “Supported” means tested, documented, and included in the platform matrix.
- “Fallback” means an intentional degraded path with a predictable visual/functional result—not disabling the feature without notice.

## Repository reuse policy

### Reuse-mode legend

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **ADOPT / WRAP** | Consume as a dependency or place a narrow ThreeNative adapter around it. |
| **FORK / PORT** | Vendor or port meaningful source into a maintained ThreeNative module after license and architecture review. |
| **MINE** | Extract algorithms, data layouts, test scenes or API ideas; do not inherit the repository wholesale. |
| **REFERENCE** | Use for comparison, validation and design evidence rather than production source. |
| **WATCH** | Promising but too young, incomplete or unstable to make foundational today. |
| **LEGAL REVIEW / MINE ONLY** | License is proprietary, unclear or absent; do not copy source without explicit clearance. |

### Source-reuse due-diligence checklist

1. [ ] **REUSE-001** — Pin the exact repository commit or release evaluated; never approve reuse against a moving default branch.
2. [ ] **REUSE-002** — Verify the license at that pin and confirm it covers the specific files, shaders, generated output and binary artifacts being reused.
3. [ ] **REUSE-003** — Audit third-party assets, datasets, submodules, vendored libraries, fonts, textures and models separately from the repository’s top-level license.
4. [ ] **REUSE-004** — Record required copyright, attribution, NOTICE, source-disclosure and modification notices in the ThreeNative distribution process.
5. [ ] **REUSE-005** — Check patent, trademark, SDK and field-of-use restrictions; escalate reciprocal, custom, proprietary or no-license sources before copying.
6. [ ] **REUSE-006** — Build and test the candidate from a clean checkout on the supported Node/TypeScript/Three.js and native toolchain versions.
7. [ ] **REUSE-007** — Run dependency, supply-chain and security review, including install/build scripts and release provenance.
8. [ ] **REUSE-008** — Implement a bounded integration spike against the relevant canonical and adversarial scenes; attach image, timing and memory evidence.
9. [ ] **REUSE-009** — Define the maintenance posture: upstream dependency, pinned fork, clean-room port, optional plugin or reference-only.
10. [ ] **REUSE-010** — Document the exit strategy for abandoned upstreams, Three.js API changes, platform incompatibility and unacceptable regressions.

> **Important:** “MIT,” “Apache-2.0,” and similar labels below are an engineering research snapshot, not legal clearance. A repository can contain files or sample assets under different terms. “No license detected” means the code is copyrighted by default and must not be copied without permission.

## 2. Baseline architecture and capability tiers

This specification assumes ThreeNative remains a React/TypeScript-facing 3D framework using Three.js as a major rendering substrate, with platform-specific implementation paths where needed. The current `@threenative/physics` package already demonstrates this direction by presenting one API over a Rapier WASM path and a native Rapier path.

Three.js' current `WebGPURenderer` can choose WebGPU and fall back to WebGL 2. Its newer post stack provides node composition, built-in MRT, and common scene attachments. Those are useful primitives, but they do not by themselves satisfy the feature-level Done definitions below.

### Capability tiers

| Tier | Minimum capability | Intended use |
|---|---|---|
| **TN-BASIC** | WebGL 2 or equivalent constrained backend; no compute assumption | Graceful fallback, simple scenes, compatibility mode |
| **TN-COMPUTE** | WebGPU render + compute, storage buffers/textures, MRT, indirect drawing where required | Primary browser and modern-device path |
| **TN-NATIVE** | Native GPU backend exposing the same ThreeNative feature contract | Android/iOS/desktop native targets declared by the project |
| **TN-RT** | Optional native acceleration structures and ray queries | Hardware-ray-traced enhancements; never assumed on standard WebGPU |

A feature may be Stable on only a subset of tiers, but the subset must be encoded in the public capability registry and documentation. For example, `VirtualGeometry` may require `TN-COMPUTE`; it must not appear enabled on `TN-BASIC` and then fail during play.

### Important WebGPU constraint

The current WebGPU specification provides programmable render and compute passes, explicit resources, buffers, textures, synchronization, validation, and device-loss handling. It does **not** standardize hardware ray-tracing acceleration structures or ray-query shaders. Therefore, browser implementations of Dynamic GI, many-light visibility, and the path tracer must use screen-space methods, probes, voxels/SDFs, or software BVHs unless a future WebGPU capability is detected. Native backends may add hardware RT behind the same contract.

## 3. Global Definition of Done

These requirements apply to **every** subsystem in this document. Feature teams should link to a single shared implementation rather than rebuilding these facilities per feature.

### 3.1 Public contract and lifecycle

1. [ ] **GLOB-API-001** — Expose a documented, typed TypeScript API and a React-facing API; both paths must share the same runtime implementation and behavior.
2. [ ] **GLOB-API-002** — Expose a machine-readable capability query returning support, active implementation, quality tier, limits, and fallback reason.
3. [ ] **GLOB-API-003** — Define ownership for every GPU, audio, physics, worker, and streamed resource; React unmount and imperative `dispose()` must release the same resources.
4. [ ] **GLOB-API-004** — Support repeated mount/unmount, scene replacement, hot reload, and renderer recreation without duplicate registrations, stale callbacks, or leaked resources.
5. [ ] **GLOB-API-005** — Use versioned, serializable feature configuration with validation, defaults, and deterministic migration of older assets.
6. [ ] **GLOB-API-006** — Reject invalid combinations with actionable diagnostics before frame execution whenever possible.
7. [ ] **GLOB-API-007** — Make asynchronous creation, compilation, baking, and streaming cancellable; cancellation must leave no partially registered runtime object.
8. [ ] **GLOB-API-008** — Document thread affinity and callback semantics for render, simulation, worker, audio, and React threads.
9. [ ] **GLOB-API-009** — Provide stable object IDs and event ordering wherever a subsystem participates in serialization, picking, history, replication, or replay.
10. [ ] **GLOB-API-010** — Keep experimental implementation details out of the stable public API, or isolate them behind explicitly experimental namespaces.

### 3.2 Shared renderer and runtime services

1. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-001** — Integrate render work through a shared frame/render graph with declared reads, writes, dependencies, lifetimes, and queue/pass type.
2. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-002** — Use a shared scene-data registry for transforms, previous transforms, bounds, material IDs, mobility, visibility layers, and feature masks.
3. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-003** — Use a shared temporal-history service that owns allocation, ping-ponging, validity, resolution changes, camera cuts, teleport detection, and destruction.
4. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-004** — Use a shared GPU resource and residency manager with byte budgets, priorities, reference counts, eviction policy, and pressure telemetry.
5. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-005** — Use shared color-management conventions: linear-light working space, declared texture color spaces, HDR range, tone-mapping location, and output transform.
6. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-006** — Use shared coordinate, handedness, scale, depth-range, camera-jitter, and world-origin conventions across rendering, physics, audio, animation, and tools.
7. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-007** — Provide quality presets plus granular overrides; changing quality at runtime must not corrupt history or leak old resources.
8. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-008** — Cache and prewarm shaders/pipelines for known variants; shipping samples must not exhibit avoidable first-use compilation stalls.
9. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-009** — Handle resize, device-pixel-ratio change, dynamic-resolution change, camera replacement, and multi-camera rendering intentionally.
10. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-010** — Handle GPU device loss and backend reinitialization according to the supported-platform policy; unrecoverable loss must surface a structured error.
11. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-011** — Define behavior for transparent objects, alpha masking, double-sided materials, skinned meshes, morph targets, instancing, and vertex/node deformation wherever applicable.
12. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-012** — Avoid unbounded per-frame CPU/GPU allocation; transient allocations must come from bounded pools or frame allocators.
13. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-013** — Label GPU passes/resources and emit CPU/GPU timing scopes so captures are intelligible in browser and native GPU debuggers.
14. [ ] **GLOB-RUN-014** — Keep runtime feature state independent of editor/devtools state; disabling diagnostics must remove their measurable shipping overhead.

### 3.3 Asset pipeline and compatibility

1. [ ] **GLOB-ASSET-001** — Define canonical source and runtime asset formats, including version, endianness, compression, coordinate conversion, and integrity/hash metadata.
2. [ ] **GLOB-ASSET-002** — Provide deterministic command-line build steps suitable for CI; identical inputs and tool versions must produce byte-identical or semantically hash-identical outputs.
3. [ ] **GLOB-ASSET-003** — Cache build outputs by source hash, settings, tool version, and platform target; stale cache entries must be rejected safely.
4. [ ] **GLOB-ASSET-004** — Validate imported assets and report unsupported features with object/material/clip-level context rather than silently dropping data.
5. [ ] **GLOB-ASSET-005** — Support glTF 2.0 as an interchange path where relevant and document any ThreeNative-specific extension or sidecar schema.
6. [ ] **GLOB-ASSET-006** — Use GPU-native texture compression/transcoding, such as KTX2/BasisU, on declared platforms; retain a documented fallback format.
7. [ ] **GLOB-ASSET-007** — Package streamable data into independently addressable chunks with checksums and cancellation-safe loading.
8. [ ] **GLOB-ASSET-008** — Keep runtime assets backward-compatible for the declared support window, with migration or rebuild instructions for breaking format changes.

### 3.4 Testing, performance, and release evidence

1. [ ] **GLOB-QA-001** — Provide unit tests for pure algorithms and state transitions, integration tests for lifecycle and cross-system behavior, and end-to-end canonical scene tests.
2. [ ] **GLOB-QA-002** — Provide visual-golden tests for every supported renderer tier, with documented perceptual and per-pixel tolerances and an approved-update workflow.
3. [ ] **GLOB-QA-003** — Run GPU/WebGPU validation with zero unexpected errors, warnings, NaNs, out-of-bounds accesses, resource hazards, or uncaptured error events.
4. [ ] **GLOB-QA-004** — Run a load/unload soak that returns CPU heap, GPU allocation, worker count, event listeners, and native handles to the documented steady-state envelope.
5. [ ] **GLOB-QA-005** — Run a long-frame soak that detects history divergence, simulation drift, memory growth, timestamp wrap/overflow, and intermittent device failures.
6. [ ] **GLOB-QA-006** — Publish a benchmark manifest containing scene hash, build hash, device/driver/browser/OS, resolution, quality settings, warm-up, sample duration, and camera path.
7. [ ] **GLOB-QA-007** — Record median and p95 CPU frame time, GPU frame time, peak and steady memory, streaming bandwidth, compilation time, and feature-specific counters.
8. [ ] **GLOB-QA-008** — Set explicit pass/fail budgets per supported reference device; 'fast enough on my machine' cannot close a requirement.
9. [ ] **GLOB-QA-009** — Test minimum limits and resource-pressure behavior, not only high-end hardware; pool overflow and allocation failure must degrade safely.
10. [ ] **GLOB-QA-010** — Test camera cuts, teleports, rapid resize, foreground/background transitions, orientation changes, and repeated quality toggles.
11. [ ] **GLOB-QA-011** — Test missing/corrupt assets, cancelled loads, shader compilation failure, device loss, and unsupported capability paths.
12. [ ] **GLOB-QA-012** — Maintain at least one adversarial scene designed to reveal the subsystem's known artifact classes, not only a flattering showcase.
13. [ ] **GLOB-QA-013** — Attach before/after captures, profiler traces, benchmark output, known limitations, and the completed requirement IDs to the Stable release record.
14. [ ] **GLOB-QA-014** — Pin or explicitly qualify the Three.js revision used by conformance tests; upgrading Three.js must rerun the affected feature suites.

### 3.5 Diagnostics, documentation, and operability

1. [ ] **GLOB-OPS-001** — Provide an in-engine debug view or inspector for the subsystem's internal data, active tier, fallback, budgets, and failure state.
2. [ ] **GLOB-OPS-002** — Expose structured counters that can be collected without parsing console text.
3. [ ] **GLOB-OPS-003** — Provide one minimal example, one production-oriented example, and one stress/adversarial example.
4. [ ] **GLOB-OPS-004** — Document setup, public API, supported combinations, platform matrix, quality controls, performance costs, failure modes, and troubleshooting.
5. [ ] **GLOB-OPS-005** — Provide migration notes for public API or asset-format changes and keep examples synchronized with the current stable API.
6. [ ] **GLOB-OPS-006** — Emit no recurring console noise during normal operation; warnings must be actionable, deduplicated, and identify the offending object or asset.
7. [ ] **GLOB-OPS-007** — Provide a feature-disable switch that returns the engine to a valid baseline path for diagnosis and emergency rollback.
8. [ ] **GLOB-OPS-008** — Assign a subsystem owner and a maintenance policy covering dependency updates, regression triage, and platform deprecation.

## 4. Benchmark manifest required for every Stable feature

Each feature's benchmark evidence must include this exact information:

```

The concrete numbers belong to ThreeNative's product targets and reference devices. This document deliberately does not invent universal millisecond or memory budgets.

A subsystem should consume these shared services. A feature-specific private history manager, resource pool, asset cache, or capability system is a design defect unless a measured technical constraint requires it.

## 6. Effort-impact priority matrix

The feature definitions below are sorted by a **weighted effort-impact priority score**, not by Unreal's marketing prominence or by implementation dependency alone.

### Scoring model

- **Impact (0–100):** Expected contribution to ThreeNative's UE5-class outcome, combining visible quality, performance leverage, scene scale, developer leverage, and breadth of use.
- **Effort (1–10):** Relative end-to-end engineering cost to reach the full Stable/Done contract in this document—not the cost of producing a curated demo.
- **Implementation ease:** `(11 − effort midpoint) × 10`.
- **Priority score:** `70% × impact + 30% × implementation ease`.
- **Impact/effort:** A raw ROI ratio shown for transparency. It is **not** the primary sort key because pure division over-rewards narrow quick wins and can bury engine-defining systems such as VirtualGeometry and DynamicGI.

The score is a planning heuristic. Dependencies still override literal rank during execution; see [Dependency-correct delivery order](#dependency-correct-delivery-order).

| Rank | Stable ID | System | Impact | Effort | Impact / effort | Priority score | Feasibility | Three.js starting point | Dominant closure dependency |

### Priority bands

| Band | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **A — Now** | Highest combined return. Build production foundations and close these early. |
| **B — Strategic** | High-impact bets. Start architecture/R&D early even when full closure comes later. |
| **C — Next** | Strong value, usually dependent on shared runtime, world, or animation foundations. |
| **D — Later / specialized** | Valuable but narrower, expensive as a complete suite, or better used first as an internal validation tool. |

### Reading the ranking correctly

- `VirtualGeometry` and `DynamicGI` rank below several cheaper systems, but they remain long-lead strategic projects and should receive early prototypes after shared foundations exist.
- `VirtualTexturing` ranks lower on standalone ROI, yet a minimum residency/streaming layer may be pulled forward because `VirtualGeometry`, `WorldPartition`, and large-world materials depend on it.
- `PathTracer` ranks last as a full customer-facing renderer, but a **minimal correctness harness** should begin much earlier to validate materials and lighting.
- `PhysicsSuite` is expensive only when treated as one UE-Chaos-sized program. Rapier rigid bodies are already the base; destruction, cloth, and vehicles should ship as separately gated modules.

# Feature Definitions of Done

<a id="f1"></a>

## F1. Cinematic post-processing stack

**ThreeNative working name:** `PostProcessing`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#1 of 20** · **Impact:** 94/100 · **Effort:** 3/10 · **Impact/effort:** 31.3 · **Priority score:** 89.8/100 · **Band:** A — Now  

**Done means:** A camera or volume can compose a predictable HDR image pipeline with production-quality exposure, tone mapping, grading, anti-aliasing, lens effects, and custom passes, with correct temporal behavior and no hidden renderer forks.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js already provides `RenderPipeline`, node-composed effects, built-in MRT, depth, velocity, normal and emissive attachments, tone mapping, LUT paths, TRAA, bloom, DOF and SSR building blocks. ThreeNative still needs an opinionated contract, volume/camera blending, lifecycle, complete effect coverage, presets, diagnostics and conformance.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `GLOB-RUN-003`, `GLOB-RUN-005`, `GLOB-RUN-007`, `TSR`, `Substrate`

4. [ ] **POST-EVID-004** — A custom third-party pass example proves the extension API without modifying ThreeNative or Three.js internals.
5. [ ] **POST-EVID-005** — Screenshots from every promised platform/tier pass the approved visual-difference thresholds.

### Repository reuse scan

> These candidates are implementation accelerators, not proof that the feature is Done. License labels are research triage at the snapshot date; re-check the exact pinned commit, submodules, generated code and bundled assets before reuse.

| Candidate | Reuse mode | Fit | License posture | What ThreeNative can borrow | Main caveat |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| [mrdoob/three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) | ADOPT / WRAP | **5/5** | MIT | WebGPURenderer, TSL, PostProcessing, MRT attachments, tone mapping, depth/normal/velocity/emissive outputs. | Three.js rendering APIs evolve; keep a narrow ThreeNative adapter and conformance tests. |
| [pmndrs/postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing) | ADOPT / PORT | **5/5** | Zlib | Composer architecture, effect lifecycle, bloom, SMAA, DOF, GTAO/SSR patterns, selection masks, pass fusion ideas. | Primarily WebGL/WebGL2; reuse APIs and algorithms without creating a second incompatible renderer graph. |
| [pmndrs/upscaler](https://github.com/pmndrs/upscaler) | ADOPT | **5/5** | MIT | Shared temporal guides, jitter, reactive masks, exposure handling, disocclusion, history reset, RCAS and TSL integration. | WebGPU-only and touches Three.js backend internals; pin Three.js versions and isolate the bridge. |
| [0beqz/realism-effects](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects) | MINE / PORT | **4/5** | MIT | TRAA, motion blur, SSGI, velocity handling, temporal accumulation and denoising patterns. | Older renderer assumptions and lower recent maintenance; treat as algorithm source, not the sole production dependency. |
| [gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer) | REFERENCE / ADOPT TEST TOOL | **4/5** | MIT | Reference-quality image oracle for tone mapping, DOF, materials, reflections, exposure and golden-scene comparisons. | Not a real-time post stack; use for validation and captures rather than frame production. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Make the Three.js WebGPU post graph and MRT outputs the single core path behind a ThreeNative adapter.
2. Adopt `pmndrs/upscaler` temporal guides early; port only the `pmndrs/postprocessing` effects that cannot be expressed cleanly in the shared graph.
3. Use `realism-effects` as a temporal/image-quality reference and `three-gpu-pathtracer` as the golden-image oracle.

### This is **not Done** when

- Only one hard-coded composer chain or showcase scene works.
- The effect stack produces double tone mapping, incorrect gamma, or order-dependent color-space bugs.
- Camera cuts, resize, or dynamic-resolution changes leave stale histories or flashes.
- Volumes cannot blend deterministically or are editor-only.
- Individual effects exist but there is no stable composition, diagnostics, or lifecycle contract.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] POST-P001** — HDR10/scRGB output calibration and metadata on supported native displays.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] POST-P002** — Cinematic lens simulation including anamorphic bloom, diaphragm blades, lens dirt, and calibrated camera profiles.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] POST-P003** — Automatic pass scheduling across async compute where the native backend can prove a benefit.

## F2. Volumetrics, fog, and god rays

**ThreeNative working name:** `Volumetrics`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#2 of 20** · **Impact:** 88/100 · **Effort:** 5/10 · **Impact/effort:** 17.6 · **Priority score:** 79.6/100 · **Band:** A — Now  

**Done means:** Participating media is lit, shadowed, temporally stable, composited with the scene, scalable across hardware, and authorable as both global atmosphere and local volumes.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js supplies fog primitives, 3D/storage textures, compute, shadow maps, lights, depth and post-processing hooks. It does not provide a unified froxel volumetric-lighting system, local media composition, temporal resolve, or production diagnostics.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `GLOB-RUN-003`, `VirtualShadows`, `DynamicGI`, `PostProcessing`

### Definition of Done checklist

#### Authoring and media model

1. [ ] **VOL-001** — Expose a global height-fog component with density, height falloff, start distance, max opacity/distance, color/albedo, extinction, emission, and anisotropy/phase controls.

8. [ ] **VOL-008** — Inject density, extinction, albedo and emission into the volume and integrate transmittance and in-scattered radiance along the view ray.
9. [ ] **VOL-009** — Illuminate media from directional, point, spot, and supported area lights with physically consistent attenuation.
10. [ ] **VOL-010** — Sample the active shadow solution so occluders produce volumetric shadows and recognizable light shafts.
11. [ ] **VOL-011** — Include sky/ambient lighting and, where enabled, an approximate Dynamic GI contribution without double counting.
12. [ ] **VOL-012** — Support emissive media and VFX injection hooks for fire, explosions, smoke, and clouds.
13. [ ] **VOL-013** — Apply temporal jitter/reprojection and spatial filtering that suppress noise without unacceptable trails around moving lights, occluders, or camera motion.
14. [ ] **VOL-014** — Composite media correctly against opaque depth, sky/background, transparent surfaces, particles, and water; document any unavoidable ordering restrictions.
15. [ ] **VOL-015** — Prevent light leakage through thin occluders using a documented depth/shadow strategy and quality controls.

#### Scalability and fallbacks

17. [ ] **VOL-017** — Provide quality controls for froxel dimensions, ray steps, shadow samples, light count, temporal weight, max distance, and local-volume complexity.
18. [ ] **VOL-018** — Provide a TN-BASIC fallback using analytic height fog and local screen-space fog volumes that preserves scene readability.
19. [ ] **VOL-019** — Cull volumes and lights by bounds and influence; inactive or fully occluded volumes must not consume full-grid work.
20. [ ] **VOL-020** — Handle camera-inside-volume, near-plane intersection, very large worlds, origin shifts, and fast teleports without precision failure or stale media.
21. [ ] **VOL-021** — Reset or reinitialize history on camera cuts, projection changes, quality-grid changes, and device restoration.

#### Diagnostics

22. [ ] **VOL-022** — Visualize froxel slices, integrated transmittance, in-scattering, density contributors, light contributors, shadow term, and temporal history weight.
23. [ ] **VOL-023** — Expose froxel dimensions, injected volume/light counts, culled counts, GPU time per stage, bytes, and history resets.
24. [ ] **VOL-024** — Identify the volume or light responsible for budget overflow, unsupported density code, or a fallback path.

### Required completion evidence

1. [ ] **VOL-EVID-001** — Canonical scenes include a sunlit cathedral, dense indoor spotlights, night fog with many local lights, moving occluders, animated smoke, camera-inside-volume, water intersection, and transparent particles.
2. [ ] **VOL-EVID-002** — A camera-cut and rapid-motion sequence shows no persistent light trails, black frames, density popping, or exposed froxel slices.
3. [ ] **VOL-EVID-003** — The low-end fallback and TN-COMPUTE implementation preserve the same public scene configuration and fail only by documented quality differences.
4. [ ] **VOL-EVID-004** — Benchmark evidence separates injection, lighting, integration, filtering, and composition costs.
5. [ ] **VOL-EVID-005** — Volumetric shadow alignment is tested against the opaque shadow result across directional and local lights.

### Repository reuse scan

> These candidates are implementation accelerators, not proof that the feature is Done. License labels are research triage at the snapshot date; re-check the exact pinned commit, submodules, generated code and bundled assets before reuse.

| Candidate | Reuse mode | Fit | License posture | What ThreeNative can borrow | Main caveat |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| [mrdoob/three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) | ADOPT / WRAP | **4/5** | MIT | 3D/storage textures, compute, depth, lights, shadow maps, TSL and post-composition plumbing. | No complete froxel volumetric system; ThreeNative still owns injection, lighting, temporal resolve and fallbacks. |
| [Ameobea/three-volumetric-pass](https://github.com/Ameobea/three-volumetric-pass) | MINE ONLY | **4/5** | No license detected | Screen-space volumetric raymarching, light-volume integration and compositing ideas for a first prototype. | No usable license was detected: do not copy code unless the author adds a compatible license or grants permission. |
| [Ameobea/three-good-godrays](https://github.com/Ameobea/three-good-godrays) | MINE ONLY | **3/5** | No license detected | Depth-aware light-shaft reconstruction, occlusion and temporal/composition ideas. | No usable license was detected; use only as behavioral inspiration until permission exists. |
| [jeantimex/procedural-clouds](https://github.com/jeantimex/procedural-clouds) | PORT / MINE | **4/5** | MIT | WebGPU volumetric cloud raymarching, density/noise fields, lighting and weather-oriented controls. | Small and early project; production integration, transparency and temporal stability remain ThreeNative work. |
| [SkyeShark/Eanpa-Sky](https://github.com/SkyeShark/Eanpa-Sky) | FORK / MINE | **5/5** | MIT; inspect bundled assets | WebGPU/TSL sky, atmosphere, volumetric clouds, weather and physically based scattering patterns. | Early-stage API and mixed asset licenses; reuse code separately from sample content. |
| [Sunset-Flock/Timberdoodle](https://github.com/Sunset-Flock/Timberdoodle) | MINE / PORT | **4/5** | Apache-2.0 | Atmosphere lookup-table generation, temporal cubemap accumulation, debug views and render-graph integration. | Daxa/Vulkan-style engine rather than Three.js; algorithms require a WGSL/TSL port. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Build the production froxel/injection contract on Three.js compute and 3D textures.
2. Port physically based atmosphere/cloud pieces from Eanpa-Sky and Timberdoodle; use the Ameobea repos only as no-copy behavioral references until licensed.
3. Unify fog, clouds, VFX injection and temporal guides instead of shipping separate one-off god-ray passes.

### This is **not Done** when

- God rays are a 2D radial blur unrelated to scene depth or occlusion.
- Only one directional light or one global fog layer works.
- Moving lights/objects leave long trails or camera cuts flash old fog.
- Transparent objects and water ignore or incorrectly double-apply fog.
- The implementation has no low-tier path, debug slices, or measurable budgets.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] VOL-P001** — Physically based multi-scattering atmosphere and volumetric clouds sharing the volume/light infrastructure.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] VOL-P002** — Per-volume material graphs with heterogeneous multiple scattering.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] VOL-P003** — Native async-compute scheduling and foveated volumetric quality for XR.

## F12. TSR-like temporal anti-aliasing and upscaling

**ThreeNative working name:** `TemporalUpscaler`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#3 of 20** · **Impact:** 94/100 · **Effort:** 6–7/10 · **Impact/effort:** 14.5 · **Priority score:** 79.3/100 · **Band:** A — Now  

**Done means:** A lower-resolution jittered frame is reconstructed into a stable higher-resolution output using complete motion/depth/exposure information, with controlled disocclusion, transparency, reactive content, camera cuts and dynamic-resolution changes.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js' WebGPU post stack provides MRT, depth, velocity and TRAA building blocks. ThreeNative must close motion-vector coverage, reactive/composition masks, reconstruction, anti-ghosting, disocclusion, dynamic-resolution, history control, quality modes and image-quality validation.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-003`, `GLOB-RUN-005`, `PostProcessing`, `Substrate`, `VFX`

### Definition of Done checklist

#### Inputs and frame contract

1. [ ] **TSR-001** — Accept internal render resolution, output resolution, viewport, jitter, current/previous view-projection, exposure and frame timing through one explicit frame contract.
2. [ ] **TSR-002** — Generate a well-distributed subpixel jitter sequence, apply it only to jittered scene rendering, and expose the non-jittered camera to gameplay/UI/picking.
3. [ ] **TSR-003** — Produce linear HDR color, depth and motion vectors at documented precisions and coordinate conventions.
4. [ ] **TSR-004** — Generate valid motion vectors for rigid meshes, camera motion, instances/batches, skinned meshes, morph targets and transform animation.
5. [ ] **TSR-005** — Define and test motion-vector support/fallback for vertex/TSL deformation, particles, ribbons, water, foliage/wind and Virtual Geometry.
6. [ ] **TSR-006** — Provide reactive and composition/transparency masks—or equivalent confidence metadata—for rapidly changing, translucent, emissive, refractive and post-composited content.
7. [ ] **TSR-007** — Track exposure/pre-exposure so history comparison is stable across automatic-exposure changes.

#### Reprojection and reconstruction

8. [ ] **TSR-008** — Reproject history using motion and depth with consistent velocity conventions and precision at screen edges and large motion.
9. [ ] **TSR-009** — Detect newly revealed/disoccluded pixels using depth, motion divergence and neighborhood information.

| [pmndrs/upscaler](https://github.com/pmndrs/upscaler) | ADOPT / FORK | **5/5** | MIT | FSR-style temporal reconstruction, jitter, motion/depth dilation, disocclusion, reactive masks, history clipping, RCAS and temporal guides. | WebGPU only; backend-internal access must be isolated and continuously tested against Three.js upgrades. |
| [mrdoob/three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) | ADOPT / WRAP | **5/5** | MIT | Velocity node, MRT, depth, jitterable cameras, FSR1Node, TRAA primitives and post graph integration. | Motion-vector coverage for deformation, particles and custom materials still needs ThreeNative contracts. |
| [GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK) | PORT / REFERENCE | **5/5** | MIT; third-party notices apply | Authoritative FSR pass ordering, constants, quality modes, reactive masks, exposure and reconstruction math. | HLSL/DX12/Vulkan-oriented source requires careful WGSL translation and parity tests. |
| [0beqz/realism-effects](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects) | MINE / PORT | **4/5** | MIT | Temporal anti-aliasing, velocity generation, neighborhood clipping and ghosting test scenes. | Not a full modern temporal upscaler; use as an additional implementation reference. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Integrate `pmndrs/upscaler` behind a ThreeNative `TemporalUpscaler` interface and pin its supported Three.js range.
2. Promote its temporal-guide products into the shared renderer service used by GI, SSR, volumetrics and denoisers.
3. Validate pass math and quality modes against FidelityFX reference code and adversarial ThreeNative scenes.

### This is **not Done** when

- It is only TAA at native resolution or FSR1-style spatial scaling.
- Static screenshots look sharp but motion/disocclusion ghosts materially.
- Skinned, instanced, particle, water or deformed geometry lacks an explicit velocity policy.
- Camera cuts and resolution changes rely on users manually clearing buffers.
- There is no debug view for rejection, masks and history validity.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] TSR-P001** — History resurrection from multiple past frames for recurring occlusion patterns.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] TSR-P002** — Optical-flow or learned reconstruction behind an optional capability tier.

## F14. Virtual Shadow Maps

**ThreeNative working name:** `VirtualShadows`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#4 of 20** · **Impact:** 96/100 · **Effort:** 7/10 · **Impact/effort:** 13.7 · **Priority score:** 79.2/100 · **Band:** A — Now  

**Done means:** Directional and local dynamic lights use a unified, demand-paged high-resolution shadow system with cache residency, precise invalidation, scalable soft shadows, deterministic overflow behavior and deep diagnostics.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js provides conventional shadow maps, light/shadow types, render targets, compute/storage resources and indirect rendering. The virtual address space, page table/pool, demand marking, clipmaps/mips, cache, invalidation, page rendering and visualization are new engine work.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `GLOB-RUN-002`, `GLOB-RUN-004`, `VirtualGeometry`, `Volumetrics`, `LayeredMaterials`

#### Directional and local light layouts

8. [ ] **VSM-008** — Implement camera-centered directional-light clipmaps or an equivalent multi-scale virtual projection covering the declared world distance.

12. [ ] **VSM-012** — Support the declared rect/area-light shadow approximation and expose source size/angle controls to filtering.
13. [ ] **VSM-013** — Keep light movement, range/cone/source-size changes and shadow enable/disable synchronized with virtual-map lifetime.

#### Rendering, cache, and invalidation

14. [ ] **VSM-014** — Render only new or invalidated physical pages and batch page rendering to minimize CPU draw submission.

17. [ ] **VSM-017** — Separate static and dynamic cached contributions, or provide equivalent behavior that avoids redrawing expensive static geometry for small dynamic changes.
18. [ ] **VSM-018** — Render conventional, instanced/batched and Virtual Geometry casters through compatible page paths.
19. [ ] **VSM-019** — Support opaque and alpha-masked casters; define transparent/translucent shadow policy and lower-tier fallback.
20. [ ] **VSM-020** — Avoid self-shadow acne, peter-panning and precision loss with documented bias/normal-bias/slope strategies suitable for high-resolution pages.

#### Filtering and consumers

21. [ ] **VSM-021** — Provide stable hard shadows and scalable soft/contact-hardening shadows based on directional source angle and local source size.
22. [ ] **VSM-022** — Filter across physical-page boundaries without visible seams and avoid sampling nonresident neighbors unsafely.
23. [ ] **VSM-023** — Expose low-resolution/coarse shadow data for volumetrics, transparency and other arbitrary-position consumers.
24. [ ] **VSM-024** — Use one public shadow configuration/fallback contract for ordinary and Virtual Geometry objects rather than separate incompatible light APIs.

### Required completion evidence

1. [ ] **VSM-EVID-001** — Canonical scenes include detailed sun shadows across large distance, many local lights, alpha foliage, skinned characters, vertex-deformed foliage, moving lights, static architecture and camera cuts.
2. [ ] **VSM-EVID-002** — A static-camera test proves page reuse; a single moving object invalidates only bounded affected pages under the declared policy.
3. [ ] **VSM-EVID-003** — Pool-overflow and constrained-memory tests degrade predictably with no corrupted page-table sampling.
4. [ ] **VSM-EVID-004** — Clipmap/mip transition routes show no persistent seams, large popping, stale shadows or missing contact detail.
5. [ ] **VSM-EVID-005** — Benchmarks separate page marking/allocation, page rendering, cache invalidation and projection/filtering.

|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| [Sunset-Flock/Timberdoodle](https://github.com/Sunset-Flock/Timberdoodle) | PORT / MINE | **5/5** | Apache-2.0 | Virtual/physical page tables, GPU page allocation, dirty tracking, page caching, wraparound cascades and hierarchical dirty-page culling. | Native bindless/mesh-shader architecture differs from WebGPU; translate the data model and algorithms. |
| [shlomnissan/virtual-textures](https://github.com/shlomnissan/virtual-textures) | ADOPT ALGORITHMS / PORT | **4/5** | MIT | Page-table encoding, physical cache allocation, residency feedback and debug visualization reusable for shadow pages. | Texture paging is not shadow rendering; invalidation, caster culling and depth filtering remain new work. |

| [mrdoob/three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) | ADOPT / WRAP | **3/5** | MIT | Shadow-camera setup, material shadow variants, depth rendering, light integration and render-target management. | Conventional shadow architecture; a virtual page renderer will require deeper renderer hooks or a dedicated path. |
| [CesiumGS/cesium](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium) | MINE | **3/5** | Apache-2.0 | Large-scale request scheduling, cache eviction, visibility prioritization and residency diagnostics. | General tile streaming rather than shadow pages; reuse scheduler/cache ideas only. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Port Timberdoodle’s VPT/PPT, dirty-page, cache and hierarchical-page-buffer design into WebGPU data structures.
2. Reuse `virtual-textures` page allocation/residency utilities where they generalize cleanly.
3. Build a dedicated Three.js shadow-material/render adapter and prove static-cache invalidation before adding local-light variants.

### This is **not Done** when

- A high-resolution atlas or cascaded shadow map is called virtual without demand paging.
- All pages redraw every frame or any moving object invalidates the whole world.
- Pool overflow produces corruption or silent missing shadows.
- Virtual Geometry, alpha masking, animation, volumetrics or local lights bypass the unified system.
- There is no page/cache/invalidation visualization.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] VSM-P001** — GPU-driven page rasterization with visibility-buffer/material bin integration.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] VSM-P002** — Advanced stochastic soft shadows and denoising comparable to high-sample area-light results.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] VSM-P003** — Persistent cross-camera page sharing with provably correct demand and invalidation.

## F3. Niagara-like GPU VFX and particles

**ThreeNative working name:** `VFX`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#5 of 20** · **Impact:** 90/100 · **Effort:** 6/10 · **Impact/effort:** 15.0 · **Priority score:** 78.0/100 · **Band:** A — Now  

**Done means:** Developers can define reusable systems made of emitters and modules, simulate them on CPU or GPU, render multiple output types, exchange data with the scene, scale by budget, and diagnose behavior without writing a one-off particle loop.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js demonstrates WebGPU compute particles, storage buffers, sprites, meshes, linked particles, rain, snow and fluid-particle experiments. The missing product is the system/emitter/module model, data interfaces, serialization, events, lifecycle, scalability, and tooling.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `GLOB-RUN-002`, `GLOB-RUN-004`, `PostProcessing`, `Substrate`, `PhysicsSuite`

19. [ ] **VFX-019** — Generate conservative bounds on CPU/GPU, cull systems/emitters, and allow fixed bounds for effects whose GPU bounds are not read back.
20. [ ] **VFX-020** — Integrate motion vectors, shadows, post-processing masks, volumetric injection, lighting, and Dynamic GI emission according to an explicit renderer support matrix.
21. [ ] **VFX-021** — Support per-system LOD/scalability rules for spawn rate, particle budget, simulation rate, renderer substitution, distance, visibility, and platform tier.

### Repository reuse scan

| [travisdmathis/plume](https://github.com/travisdmathis/plume) | ADOPT / MINE | **5/5** | MIT | Niagara-like VFX data model, authoring/editor concepts, emitters, modules and effect serialization. | Validate current package boundaries and WebGPU renderer compatibility before making it foundational. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Spike `Three-VFX` and `plume` against the same canonical effects and choose one runtime/data model as the base.
2. Separate the compute simulation core from React/editor adapters, then add a stable serialized module schema.
3. Use Three.js compute/indirect primitives for the high tier and `three-nebula`/`three-particles` ideas for the deliberate fallback path.

### This is **not Done** when

- The engine merely wraps `Points` or ships several unrelated effect classes.
- High-count simulation reads particle state back to the CPU every frame.
- Effects cannot be serialized, parameterized, pooled, or debugged.
- Only sprites work; mesh/ribbon output and events are absent.
- Particle counts, event queues, sorting, or buffers can grow without a hard budget.

## F17. Nanite-like virtualized geometry

**ThreeNative working name:** `VirtualGeometry`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#6 of 20** · **Impact:** 100/100 · **Effort:** 8–9/10 · **Impact/effort:** 11.8 · **Priority score:** 77.5/100 · **Band:** B — Strategic  

**Done means:** High-detail static geometry is preprocessed into a hierarchical cluster representation, selected and culled on GPU by projected error, submitted indirectly, streamed under a memory budget, and rendered consistently into all required passes with documented fallbacks.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js provides storage/compute resources, `BatchedMesh`, indirect draw buffers and the conventional raster pipeline. Meshoptimizer supplies mature MIT-licensed meshlet, bounds, simplification, clustered LOD and compression building blocks. ThreeNative must still own the runtime asset, hierarchy, traversal, HZB occlusion, submission, residency, materials, pass integration and diagnostics.

20. [ ] **VGEO-020** — Render selected clusters with correct vertex attributes, transforms, negative-scale/winding policy and material IDs.
21. [ ] **VGEO-021** — Support many instances of one virtual-geometry asset without duplicating geometry pages.

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Adopt meshoptimizer immediately for the offline pipeline and pin a deterministic output format.
2. Use `nanite-webgpu` as the primary WebGPU seed and Timberdoodle as the GPU-driven/visibility-buffer architecture reference.
3. Ship meshlet culling + hierarchical LOD first, then add page residency/streaming; defer software rasterization until measured necessity.

### This is **not Done** when

- The feature is only automatic discrete LOD generation.
- Clusters are built but selected or submitted one-by-one from CPU.
- Occlusion, streaming, indirect limits or missing-page behavior are absent.
- Beauty rendering works while shadows, velocity, picking or GI fall back incorrectly.
- Unsupported deforming/translucent geometry silently disappears instead of using conventional fallback.

## F13. Substrate-like layered materials

**ThreeNative working name:** `LayeredMaterials`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#7 of 20** · **Impact:** 91/100 · **Effort:** 6–7/10 · **Impact/effort:** 14.0 · **Priority score:** 77.2/100 · **Band:** B — Strategic  

**Done means:** Artists and code can compose physically meaningful material lobes through horizontal mixing and vertical layering; the compiler preserves energy behavior, simplifies by platform tier, and emits consistent results for every render pass.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js TSL and `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial` already expose programmable node shading and lobes such as clearcoat, sheen, anisotropy, iridescence, transmission and dispersion. ThreeNative must add a first-class layered-BSDF model, compiler rules, asset instances/functions, pass parity, simplification and material diagnostics.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `GLOB-RUN-005`, `PostProcessing`, `VirtualShadows`, `DynamicGI`, `PathTracer`

20. [ ] **MAT-020** — Produce defined fallback materials for unsupported graphs without rendering black, pink, NaN or silently wrong output.
21. [ ] **MAT-021** — Preserve physically equivalent results as closely as practical across WebGPU and native shader backends.

#### Pass and system integration

22. [ ] **MAT-022** — Emit consistent variants for beauty/depth, alpha mask, shadow, motion vectors, object ID/picking, reflection/GI capture and path tracing.
23. [ ] **MAT-023** — Expose the parameters/closures required by Dynamic GI, reflections, Virtual Shadows, volumetrics and many-light evaluation without reimplementing material logic in each subsystem.

2. [ ] **MAT-EVID-002** — Furnace/energy tests show no unexplained energy gain/loss beyond documented approximations.
3. [ ] **MAT-EVID-003** — Beauty, shadow, velocity, GI/reflection and path-tracer/raster comparison captures agree on masking, normals, emission and deformation.
4. [ ] **MAT-EVID-004** — Tier simplification tests prove predictable fallback rather than shader failure or random lobe loss.
5. [ ] **MAT-EVID-005** — A third-party material function/lobe package proves the extension, serialization and compiler diagnostics contract.

### Repository reuse scan

| [mrdoob/three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) | ADOPT / EXTEND | **5/5** | MIT | TSL, NodeMaterial, MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial, BSDF building blocks, shader generation and WebGPU/WebGL material integration. | No general layered-BSDF closure system; ThreeNative must own composition semantics and permutation control. |
| [AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX) | ADOPT / PORT | **5/5** | Apache-2.0 | Portable material graph representation, node definitions, standard libraries, validation and interchange. | Runtime compiler integration and compact mobile/WebGPU targets require a focused subset. |

| [pmndrs/lamina](https://github.com/pmndrs/lamina) | MINE API | **3/5** | MIT | Ergonomic declarative material-layer API and React integration patterns. | Visual shader layering is not a physically correct layered-BSDF system. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Keep TSL/NodeMaterial as the executable substrate and define a compact ThreeNative layered-BSDF IR above it.
2. Align artist parameters and conformance assets with OpenPBR; use MaterialX for interchange rather than exposing either format as runtime state.
3. Port verified BSDF math from OpenPBR/Filament and borrow only Lamina’s declarative ergonomics.

### This is **not Done** when

- It is only a renamed `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial` with no layer semantics.
- Material behavior differs between beauty, shadow, velocity and GI passes.
- Arbitrary layer mixes create uncontrolled energy gain or NaNs.
- Every parameter change recompiles shaders or creates unbounded variants.
- Unsupported mobile/basic-tier materials silently render incorrectly.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

2. [ ] **[PARITY] MAT-P002** — Spectral rendering or wavelength-aware thin-film/dispersion on selected native paths.

## F16. Lumen-like dynamic global illumination and reflections

**ThreeNative working name:** `DynamicGI`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#8 of 20** · **Impact:** 100/100 · **Effort:** 9–10/10 · **Impact/effort:** 10.5 · **Priority score:** 74.5/100 · **Band:** B — Strategic  

**Done means:** Fully dynamic lights, sky and emissive surfaces produce temporally stable indirect diffuse lighting and rough-to-glossy reflections, including meaningful off-screen contribution and dynamic scene updates, with a software WebGPU path and optional native hardware-RT enhancement.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js provides SSGI, SSR, light probes, MRT/depth/normals/velocity, TSL, compute and storage resources. These cover screen-space and plumbing pieces, but not a world-space scene/radiance representation, off-screen visibility, cache updates, multi-bounce approximation, unified reflections, large-world streaming or production diagnostics.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `GLOB-RUN-002`, `GLOB-RUN-003`, `GLOB-RUN-004`, `LayeredMaterials`, `VirtualShadows`, `WorldPartition`, `PathTracer`

### Definition of Done checklist

6. [ ] **GI-006** — Partition/clipmap the representation for large worlds and integrate residency with World Partition and the shared resource manager.

8. [ ] **GI-008** — Inject direct-light, sky and emissive radiance into the world-space representation with physically consistent units relative to direct shading.
9. [ ] **GI-009** — Trace/reconstruct first-bounce indirect diffuse lighting using screen-space information first where useful and world-space fallback for off-screen/missed rays.
10. [ ] **GI-010** — Provide at least an approximate multi-bounce response so enclosed scenes do not lose all secondary color propagation.
11. [ ] **GI-011** — Produce indirect sky occlusion/shadowing in interiors and contact regions rather than adding a uniform ambient term.
12. [ ] **GI-012** — Respond to moving lights and emissive surfaces within the documented latency without full cache restart.
13. [ ] **GI-013** — Respond to opening/closing doors, moving occluders, spawned/despawned objects and streamed cells without persistent leaks or black voids.
14. [ ] **GI-014** — Support a controllable update budget and prioritization by camera proximity, visibility, lighting change and cache staleness.
15. [ ] **GI-015** — Define behavior for tiny/bright emissives, thin geometry, backfaces and two-sided foliage so known leak/noise cases are bounded.

#### Reflections

16. [ ] **GI-016** — Provide reflections across the supported roughness range, selecting among screen traces, world-space traces/cache, probes/environment and optional native RT.
17. [ ] **GI-017** — Blend fallback paths without obvious screen-edge holes, black behind-camera regions or double energy.
18. [ ] **GI-018** — Support rough-reflection convolution/importance sampling and temporal reconstruction appropriate to the active representation.
19. [ ] **GI-019** — Reflect dynamic lights, emissive surfaces and moving geometry according to the documented path and latency.
20. [ ] **GI-020** — Respect material normals, roughness, metal/dielectric response, transmission policy and layered-material output.
21. [ ] **GI-021** — Define mirror-like planar/glossy limitations and integrate a planar or native-RT escape hatch where the general path cannot meet quality.

#### Sampling, reconstruction, and composition

22. [ ] **GI-022** — Use temporal reprojection with motion/depth/material validation and reset correctly on cuts, teleports, origin shifts, scale changes and scene-representation resets.
23. [ ] **GI-023** — Apply spatial/temporal denoising that preserves contact detail and moving edges while avoiding persistent trails and boiling.
24. [ ] **GI-024** — Clamp fireflies/outliers without crushing legitimate high-dynamic-range emissive transport.
25. [ ] **GI-025** — Compose direct lighting, indirect diffuse, specular/reflections, ambient occlusion, emissive and precomputed/probe fallback without double counting.
26. [ ] **GI-026** — Feed supported translucency and volumetrics with a documented lower-frequency/quality indirect-lighting approximation.
27. [ ] **GI-027** — Support dynamic resolution and reduced GI resolution with stable reconstruction.

#### Backend strategy and diagnostics

29. [ ] **GI-029** — Ship a standard-WebGPU path that does not depend on hardware ray-query APIs.
30. [ ] **GI-030** — Allow an optional TN-RT implementation to replace visibility/intersection stages without changing authored scene/material APIs.
31. [ ] **GI-031** — Visualize screen traces, fallback traces, hit/miss distance, world representation, probes/surfels/voxels, radiance cache, update regions, diffuse result, reflection result, history confidence and denoiser inputs.
32. [ ] **GI-032** — Expose rays/samples, screen-hit rate, fallback-hit rate, cache occupancy/age, update work, invalidations, representation bytes and GPU time by stage.
33. [ ] **GI-033** — Identify unsupported geometry/material paths and the exact fallback used for each selected object.
34. [ ] **GI-034** — Provide freeze-cache, disable-screen-trace, disable-world-trace, single-bounce and reference-quality debug switches.

### Required completion evidence

1. [ ] **GI-EVID-001** — Canonical scenes include window-lit interiors, opening doors, moving sun/local lights, emissive signs, colored rooms, thin walls, foliage, moving characters, reflective corridors, rough metals and off-screen reflectors.
2. [ ] **GI-EVID-002** — Path-traced reference captures quantify diffuse and reflection error for static checkpoints at each shipping quality tier.
3. [ ] **GI-EVID-003** — Temporal videos—not only stills—cover camera motion, dynamic objects/lights, disocclusion, emissive animation, cuts and world-cell streaming.
4. [ ] **GI-EVID-004** — An off-screen test proves lighting/reflections do not collapse when the contributing object/light leaves the camera view.
5. [ ] **GI-EVID-005** — Leak/noise adversarial scenes cover thin walls, stacked geometry, tiny bright emitters, large empty spaces, enclosed rooms and fast changes.
6. [ ] **GI-EVID-006** — Benchmarks separate scene update, trace, radiance/cache update, diffuse resolve, reflection resolve and denoising, plus representation memory.

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Run side-by-side spikes of `webgiya` and `speedball` on the canonical indoor/outdoor dynamic-GI scenes.
2. Retain Three.js/realism-effects SSGI as near-field detail while choosing one world-space surfel/probe representation.
3. Use `three-gpu-pathtracer` captures as the quality oracle and gate adoption on memory/update-budget evidence.

### This is **not Done** when

- The feature is only SSAO, SSGI or SSR and loses all contribution outside the current screen.
- Dynamic geometry/light changes require rebaking or rebuilding the whole world.
- Diffuse GI exists but reflections are a separate incompatible system with visible holes.
- Temporal denoising produces persistent trails, boiling, or cut-history flashes in canonical motion tests.
- No path-traced reference, off-screen test, cache visualization or fallback matrix exists.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] GI-P001** — Hardware ray-traced hit lighting and acceleration-structure updates on TN-RT platforms.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] GI-P002** — Higher-fidelity translucency, hair and volumetric global illumination.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] GI-P003** — Radiance-field/neural cache implementations behind the same contract.

### Repository reuse scan

> These candidates are implementation accelerators, not proof that the feature is Done. License labels are research triage at the snapshot date; re-check the exact pinned commit, submodules, generated code and bundled assets before reuse.

| [dgreenheck/ez-tree](https://github.com/dgreenheck/ez-tree) | ADOPT / MINE | **4/5** | MIT | Production-friendly procedural vegetation generation, seeded parameters and export/runtime integration. | Tree generation is a leaf node; ThreeNative still needs the graph, data flow, caching and world binding. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Define the deterministic PCG data model and evaluator before selecting the graph-editor UI.
2. Adopt focused primitives such as `three-bvh-csg`, Poisson sampling and ez-tree as library nodes behind stable adapters.
3. Use xyflow or Rete only for authoring; compile graphs into editor-independent versioned runtime assets.

### This is **not Done** when

- Procedural generation is a collection of helper functions with no serializable graph/data model.
- Results change with worker timing or World Partition cell load order.
- Any edit rebuilds the entire world.
- Generated output creates one React/Three object per point at scale.
- There is no provenance/debug preview, build cache, or runtime cancellation.

## F9. Motion Matching

**ThreeNative working name:** `MotionMatching`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#10 of 20** · **Impact:** 84/100 · **Effort:** 6/10 · **Impact/effort:** 14.0 · **Priority score:** 73.8/100 · **Band:** C — Next  

**Done means:** A runtime query built from desired trajectory and current pose selects high-quality poses from a preprocessed animation database, blends them without visible discontinuity, preserves contacts/root motion, and can be inspected and tuned.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js supplies skeletal clips, mixers, keyframes and interpolation. The feature database, extraction schema, search/index, costs, transition logic, inertialization, trajectory integration, contacts, retargeting and diagnostics must be built.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-ASSET-002`, `Sequencer`, `ControlRig`, `Mass`

### Definition of Done checklist

#### Animation ingest and database build

1. [ ] **MM-001** — Validate skeleton compatibility, sample rate, root-motion conventions, clip metadata and required joints when importing source animations.

18. [ ] **MM-018** — Handle root motion, in-place animation and controller-driven motion with an explicit policy and no double application.
19. [ ] **MM-019** — Preserve planted contacts using contact-aware costs plus IK/warping integration; expose foot-lock failures for diagnosis.
20. [ ] **MM-020** — Support play-rate/stride or distance matching so locomotion speed changes do not force visible sliding.
21. [ ] **MM-021** — Handle turns, starts, stops, pivots, jumps/falls/landings and uneven terrain according to the declared database scope.
22. [ ] **MM-022** — Feed Control Rig/IK after pose selection and integrate with Sequencer override/blending rules.
23. [ ] **MM-023** — Provide a scalable crowd path that shares databases and avoids a full expensive search every frame per distant agent.

#### Authoring and diagnostics

24. [ ] **MM-024** — Visualize the current query trajectory, sampled joints, selected pose, candidate poses and source clip frame.
25. [ ] **MM-025** — Expose total and per-channel candidate costs, selected/continuing cost, search time, candidates visited, index recall mode and switch reason.

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Port the Orange Duck reference pipeline into an offline database builder plus a compact runtime query library.
2. Use Three.js only for final pose application/blending and isolate database search from render-frame allocations.
3. Treat external motion datasets as test inputs with separately verified redistribution rights.

### This is **not Done** when

- The runtime simply chooses clips from speed/direction thresholds.
- There is no offline pose database, exact-reference search or cost decomposition.
- Pose choice is good in a demo but cannot be reproduced or diagnosed.
- Contacts/root motion visibly slide and there is no measurable acceptance criterion.
- Every crowd agent performs an unrestricted full search every frame.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] MM-P001** — Learned embeddings or neural motion matching with deterministic fallback.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] MM-P002** — Motion/pose warping to arbitrary traversal targets and environment constraints.

## F4. Water system

**ThreeNative working name:** `Water`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#11 of 20** · **Impact:** 75/100 · **Effort:** 4/10 · **Impact/effort:** 18.8 · **Priority score:** 73.5/100 · **Band:** C — Next  

**Done means:** Oceans, lakes and rivers share a continuous scalable surface, physically coherent shading, underwater rendering, runtime water queries and physics interaction, instead of being unrelated demo shaders.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js has water examples/material primitives, reflection/refraction tools, compute, geometry LOD and scene depth. ThreeNative must supply water-body semantics, continuous meshing, optical model, river flow, interaction, queries, buoyancy, streaming and diagnostics.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `PostProcessing`, `DynamicGI`, `VirtualShadows`, `WorldPartition`, `PhysicsSuite`

### Definition of Done checklist

22. [ ] **WATER-022** — Provide flow sampling suitable for particles, floating debris, swimming, and gameplay without requiring GPU readback per object.
23. [ ] **WATER-023** — Define collision, navmesh, character-controller and camera behavior at water boundaries.

4. [ ] **WATER-EVID-004** — Buoyancy tests cover stable floating, partially submerged objects, high speed, sleeping/waking bodies, and body transitions.
5. [ ] **WATER-EVID-005** — The benchmark separates base surface, reflections/refraction, waves, interaction, underwater, and query costs.

### Repository reuse scan

> These candidates are implementation accelerators, not proof that the feature is Done. License labels are research triage at the snapshot date; re-check the exact pinned commit, submodules, generated code and bundled assets before reuse.

|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| [reed-soul/SeedOcean](https://github.com/reed-soul/SeedOcean) | ADOPT / FORK | **5/5** | MIT | Three.js/WebGPU FFT ocean, cascades, foam, buoyancy queries, underwater effects, spray/rain and WebGL fallback. | Audit numerical stability, mobile cost and renderer-version coupling before using as the production water core. |

| [jbouny/fft-ocean](https://github.com/jbouny/fft-ocean) | MINE / PORT | **4/5** | MIT; verify at pin | Classic Three.js FFT ocean architecture, spectrum update and displacement/normal generation. | Older WebGL assumptions and precision/performance model need modernization. |
| [jeantimex/threejs-water](https://github.com/jeantimex/threejs-water) | MINE | **4/5** | MIT; verify at pin | Interactive water surface, refraction/reflection, caustics and object-water interaction patterns. | Focused demo rather than complete ocean/river/lake body system. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Benchmark SeedOcean as the first runtime base because it already spans FFT, buoyancy, underwater and fallback concerns.
2. Mine abyssal-ocean and older FFT/water repos for spectra, caustics and simpler fallbacks rather than merging multiple runtimes.
3. Build a ThreeNative water-body topology/query layer above the renderer so oceans, rivers and lakes share gameplay APIs.

### This is **not Done** when

- A single plane shader is presented as the water system.
- Rendered waves and physics/query heights disagree materially.
- Only an ocean works; rivers, lakes, overlaps, and transitions are absent.
- Screen-space reflections disappear with no fallback.
- Underwater, buoyancy, streaming, and debug behavior are missing.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] WATER-P001** — FFT ocean spectrum with cascaded wave bands and weather transitions.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] WATER-P002** — Fluid coupling, breaking waves, shoreline erosion, and gameplay-scale shallow-water simulation.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] WATER-P003** — Authoring tools for automatic river carving and terrain/water-body conformance.

## F18. MegaLights-like many-light rendering

**ThreeNative working name:** `ManyLights`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#12 of 20** · **Impact:** 89/100 · **Effort:** 7–8/10 · **Impact/effort:** 11.9 · **Priority score:** 72.8/100 · **Band:** C — Next  

**Done means:** Scenes can contain a product-defined high count of dynamic local/area lights with shadows while per-pixel work remains bounded through clustering and/or stochastic sampling, with stable visibility, temporal reconstruction, fallbacks and transparent performance evidence.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js now provides Forward+ `ClusteredLighting` for many point lights, with configurable light and per-cluster capacities. ThreeNative must extend this into multiple light shapes, scalable shadow visibility, importance/sampling policy, temporal stability, material/volumetric integration and robust overflow behavior.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `GLOB-RUN-002`, `VirtualShadows`, `LayeredMaterials`, `Volumetrics`, `DynamicGI`

### Definition of Done checklist

6. [ ] **ML-006** — Partition the view into 3D clusters/tiles or an equivalent structure and assign only intersecting candidate lights.
7. [ ] **ML-007** — Cull lights by bounds, view, layer, range and negligible contribution before expensive visibility/shading.
8. [ ] **ML-008** — Keep candidate generation GPU-driven or otherwise bounded so light movement does not create per-object/per-light CPU combinatorics.
9. [ ] **ML-009** — Handle per-cluster overflow through deterministic top-contribution selection, secondary lists, stochastic sampling or quality degradation—not memory corruption.
10. [ ] **ML-010** — When exact evaluation exceeds the tier budget, importance-sample a bounded number of lights with a documented estimator and energy behavior.
11. [ ] **ML-011** — If stochastic sampling is used, reuse samples temporally and optionally spatially while validating visibility/material changes.
12. [ ] **ML-012** — Avoid systematic bias where small bright, large dim, nearby, shadowed or off-center area lights are never selected.

#### Visibility, shadows, and reconstruction

13. [ ] **ML-013** — Resolve selected-light visibility through Virtual Shadows, SDF/software-BVH visibility, screen-space tests, optional TN-RT rays or a documented hybrid.
14. [ ] **ML-014** — Support area-source soft shadows at the quality promised for each light shape.
15. [ ] **ML-015** — Bound and prioritize shadow updates separately from unshadowed light evaluation.
16. [ ] **ML-016** — Denoise/reconstruct stochastic direct light with motion/depth/normal/material validation and camera-cut reset.
17. [ ] **ML-017** — Respond to moving lights and occluders within the documented latency without long-lived light ghosts.
18. [ ] **ML-018** — Provide a conservative fallback when a selected light's shadow page/visibility data is unavailable.
19. [ ] **ML-019** — Avoid double counting direct light with Dynamic GI and preserve energy behavior through Layered Materials.

#### Scene integration and scalability

20. [ ] **ML-020** — Support opaque and alpha-masked geometry; define transparent, particle, hair, water and decal lighting policy.
21. [ ] **ML-021** — Feed Volumetrics with bounded/coarse light and shadow data instead of evaluating every light in every froxel.
22. [ ] **ML-022** — Integrate with instanced/batched and Virtual Geometry without per-instance light lists on CPU.
23. [ ] **ML-023** — Provide quality controls for cluster dimensions, light limits, samples/pixel, temporal/spatial reuse, shadow quality and max affected distance.
24. [ ] **ML-024** — Fall back to Three.js ClusteredLighting or a bounded conventional-light path on tiers lacking the advanced visibility/sampling route.
25. [ ] **ML-025** — Support dynamic resolution, multiple cameras and origin shifts with independent cluster/history state.

#### Diagnostics

26. [ ] **ML-026** — Visualize clusters, candidate counts, overflow, selected lights, sample probability/weight, visibility source, shadow availability, temporal age/confidence and per-light contribution.
27. [ ] **ML-027** — Expose total/visible/candidate/selected/shadowed light counts, overflow clusters, rays/shadow samples, cache hits, rejection, GPU time and memory.

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Extend Three.js Forward+ as the baseline candidate-light system instead of replacing it.
2. Port reservoir sampling from permissive references such as aten; use RTXDI documentation/source only under explicit legal guidance.
3. Solve scalable visibility with VSM/shadow caches first, then add stochastic sampling and temporal reuse.

### This is **not Done** when

- The feature is only Three.js `ClusteredLighting` renamed without scalable shadow visibility.
- A headline light count ignores shadows, materials, depth complexity, resolution or frame budget.
- Per-cluster overflow silently drops arbitrary lights.
- Stochastic lighting visibly flickers/ghosts and has no exact-reference validation.
- Volumetrics, transparency, Virtual Geometry or Dynamic GI double count/bypass the many-light path.

## F8. World Partition, streaming, and HLOD

**ThreeNative working name:** `WorldPartition`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#13 of 20** · **Impact:** 79/100 · **Effort:** 6/10 · **Impact/effort:** 13.2 · **Priority score:** 70.3/100 · **Band:** C — Next  

**Done means:** A large world is packaged into independently streamable cells, loaded by explicit streaming sources under memory and latency budgets, and represented by HLODs when detailed cells are absent, without gameplay identity loss or visible holes.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js offers loaders, LOD, batching and external 3D Tiles ecosystems, but no authoritative world-cell model, packaging pipeline, streaming scheduler, data layers, persistent-state handoff, HLOD generation, or integrated diagnostics.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-ASSET-001`, `GLOB-RUN-004`, `PCG`, `Mass`, `VirtualGeometry`, `VirtualTexturing`, `PhysicsSuite`

### Definition of Done checklist

#### World and cell model

1. [ ] **WORLD-001** — Define a versioned spatial partition scheme—grid, quadtree, octree or hybrid—with deterministic cell IDs and world bounds.
2. [ ] **WORLD-002** — Assign streamable objects, entities, assets and generated data to cells while supporting always-loaded/global objects.
3. [ ] **WORLD-003** — Support named data layers/scenarios that independently control inclusion, activation, loading and build output.
4. [ ] **WORLD-004** — Represent inter-cell dependencies explicitly and detect cycles, missing dependencies and objects that illegally span cells.
5. [ ] **WORLD-005** — Define ownership and persistence for gameplay state when a cell unloads and reloads.
6. [ ] **WORLD-006** — Implement a large-world precision strategy such as camera-relative rendering and/or origin rebasing, shared with physics, audio, particles and temporal systems.

#### Streaming runtime

7. [ ] **WORLD-007** — Support one or more streaming sources with shape, position, direction, velocity, target range, priority and layer filters.
8. [ ] **WORLD-008** — Select cells using load/activate/unload radii or equivalent hysteresis so small camera movement does not thrash residency.
9. [ ] **WORLD-009** — Load, decode, create GPU resources, activate gameplay, deactivate and unload through explicit asynchronous stages.
10. [ ] **WORLD-010** — Prioritize visible/soon-visible cells using distance, camera velocity, portals/teleports, gameplay importance and dependency criticality.
11. [ ] **WORLD-011** — Support cancellation, reprioritization and fast travel; obsolete loads must not block newly critical cells.
12. [ ] **WORLD-012** — Enforce CPU, GPU and IO budgets with deterministic eviction and protected working sets.
13. [ ] **WORLD-013** — Expose readiness barriers for gameplay/cinematics and a nonblocking fallback when a requested area is not ready.
14. [ ] **WORLD-014** — Keep physics, nav, audio, VFX, PCG, Mass entities, lighting and render resources synchronized with cell activation state.
15. [ ] **WORLD-015** — Prewarm required shaders/pipelines and avoid first-entry compilation spikes for known cell content.

#### HLOD build and runtime

17. [ ] **WORLD-017** — Build one or more HLOD levels from cell/object groups using merge, instancing, simplification, impostor or Virtual Geometry strategies.
18. [ ] **WORLD-018** — Generate proxy materials/textures that preserve major albedo, normal, roughness, emissive, opacity and lighting behavior within declared tolerances.
19. [ ] **WORLD-019** — Preserve object exclusion rules, shadows, collision/query policy, selection/picking metadata and visibility/data-layer membership.
20. [ ] **WORLD-020** — Display HLOD proxies while source cells are absent and transition to/from detailed content without gaps, double rendering or severe popping.
21. [ ] **WORLD-021** — Build HLODs incrementally and cache outputs by source asset/settings/tool hashes.
22. [ ] **WORLD-022** — Validate proxy bounds and screen-space error so incorrect bounds cannot unload visible detail or explode culling cost.

#### Diagnostics and operations

23. [ ] **WORLD-023** — Visualize grid/cell bounds, streaming sources, requested/loading/active/evicting states, priorities, data layers and HLOD levels.
24. [ ] **WORLD-024** — Expose resident/pending cell counts, stage latency, bytes by resource class, IO throughput, cancellations, evictions, HLOD draw savings and missed deadlines.
25. [ ] **WORLD-025** — Record a streaming trace that explains why each cell loaded/unloaded and which dependency or budget delayed it.
26. [ ] **WORLD-026** — Provide build reports for cell size distribution, dependency fan-out, always-loaded content, duplicate assets and HLOD effectiveness.

### Required completion evidence

1. [ ] **WORLD-EVID-001** — A large canonical world runs a deterministic camera/player route, fast travel, reverse route and data-layer switch while recording streaming and memory.
2. [ ] **WORLD-EVID-002** — No route frame exposes an unintentional world hole, missing collision, duplicate actor/entity, stale light/audio source or HLOD/detail overlap.
3. [ ] **WORLD-EVID-003** — A constrained-memory run proves budget-respecting eviction and recovery instead of unbounded allocation.
4. [ ] **WORLD-EVID-004** — Origin-shift tests cover rendering, physics, particles, audio, motion vectors, temporal histories and water.
5. [ ] **WORLD-EVID-005** — Incremental build tests prove a local edit rebuilds only affected cells/HLODs and their true dependents.

### Repository reuse scan

|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| [NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS) | ADOPT / FORK | **5/5** | Apache-2.0 | Three.js-native hierarchical tileset traversal, screen-space error, request scheduling, cache eviction, loaders and large-scene streaming. | 3D Tiles semantics may not map one-to-one to ThreeNative world cells; wrap rather than expose directly. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Adopt 3DTilesRendererJS traversal/cache code behind a ThreeNative cell-manifest adapter for the first streaming implementation.
2. Mine Cesium for prioritization, precision and failure behavior; use loaders.gl workers for asynchronous decoding.
3. Keep offline HLOD generation and runtime streaming as separate packages with a versioned manifest between them.

### This is **not Done** when

- The system is distance-based `LOD` or manual loader calls without cell ownership and budgets.
- Fast travel waits behind obsolete requests or shows uncontrolled holes.
- Cell unload destroys persistent gameplay identity or leaves physics/audio behind.
- HLODs are hand-authored and not generated, cached, validated and transitioned by the system.
- There is no explainable streaming trace or hard memory policy.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] WORLD-P001** — Server-authoritative replication-aware streaming and per-client relevance.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] WORLD-P002** — Portal/room visibility and semantic streaming volumes combined with distance sources.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] WORLD-P003** — Remote CDN patching and live cell-version migration.

**Effort-impact priority:** **#14 of 20** · **Impact:** 77/100 · **Effort:** 6/10 · **Impact/effort:** 12.8 · **Priority score:** 68.9/100 · **Band:** C — Next  

**Done means:** A serializable rig graph can procedurally control skeletons and scene transforms using a production solver suite, spaces, constraints and controls, and can blend predictably with animation, Motion Matching and Sequencer.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js supplies skeleton/skinning infrastructure and an add-on CCD IK solver with joint limits and helpers.

22. [ ] **RIG-022** — Support additive and absolute rig layers with runtime blend weights and safe enable/disable transitions.
23. [ ] **RIG-023** — Provide retarget chains, root/scale policy, reference poses and per-chain settings for declared skeleton families.
24. [ ] **RIG-024** — Integrate controls and rig parameters as Sequencer tracks with deterministic seek/scrub evaluation.

5. [ ] **RIG-EVID-005** — Crowd and hero-character benchmarks measure solver rate, culled/update-rate behavior and memory.

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Use Three.js skeleton/animation and CCD IK as the baseline runtime contract.
2. Port and benchmark FABRIK/full-body solvers from THREE.IK/fullik/IK.ts behind interchangeable solver interfaces.
3. Use three-vrm only as a humanoid adapter and build the Control Rig graph/constraint asset independently.

### This is **not Done** when

- Only CCD IK exists with no rig asset or graph.
- Rig results depend on incidental update order or previous editor interaction.
- Solvers cannot layer with animation/Motion Matching/Sequencer.
- Retargeting, limits, spaces or pose diagnostics are absent.
- Current and previous skinning poses diverge, causing rendering artifacts.

22. [ ] **MASS-022** — Support spawn-data sources from PCG, authored zones, gameplay events and World Partition cells.

#### Diagnostics and safety

23. [ ] **MASS-023** — Inspect archetypes, component layouts, chunk occupancy, queries, processors, dependencies, entity state and representation LOD.
24. [ ] **MASS-024** — Expose entity/chunk/archetype counts, structural changes, processor timings, worker utilization, rendered-instance counts, promotions and memory by component.

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Spike Miniplex and bitECS with the actual crowd benchmark; prefer Miniplex ergonomics unless SoA gains justify MPL isolation.
2. Adopt Recast/Detour for navmesh and low-level crowd navigation; layer Yuka-style decision/steering above ECS data.
3. Use GPU crowd simulation only for representation/avoidance LODs where deterministic gameplay state is not required.

### This is **not Done** when

- Crowds are implemented as thousands of React components or Three.js objects.
- The project has instanced rendering but no data-oriented entity runtime.
- Systems mutate structure during iteration without a safe command model.
- Representation LOD loses identity or gameplay state.
- A benchmark quotes entity count without scene, behavior, rendering and frame-budget evidence.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

## F7. Sequencer and cinematic timeline

**ThreeNative working name:** `Sequencer`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#16 of 20** · **Impact:** 68/100 · **Effort:** 4/10 · **Impact/effort:** 17.0 · **Priority score:** 68.6/100 · **Band:** C — Next  

**Done means:** Serializable timelines can deterministically animate and bind scene properties, cameras, skeletal animation, audio, VFX, materials, lights and events at runtime and during capture, with nested shots and predictable seek/scrub behavior.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js supplies clips, mixers, keyframe tracks, property binding and interpolation. ThreeNative must add a multi-track timeline model, object bindings, evaluation rules, nested sequences, camera cuts, non-animation tracks, event semantics, authoring tools and capture integration.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-002`, `PostProcessing`, `VFX`, `MetaAudio`, `ControlRig`, `MotionMatching`

8. [ ] **SEQ-008** — Evaluate deterministically for a given time and binding state, independent of previous playback direction except where a track explicitly maintains state.
9. [ ] **SEQ-009** — Define pre-roll, post-roll, warm-up, evaluation range and completion behavior such as restore state, keep state or custom completion.
10. [ ] **SEQ-010** — Blend overlapping numeric, vector, quaternion, color and transform sections with documented absolute/additive/relative semantics.
11. [ ] **SEQ-011** — Handle camera cuts as first-class events that notify temporal rendering systems, audio listeners, input/camera controllers and capture.
12. [ ] **SEQ-012** — Define event-track semantics for forward play, reverse, seek, scrub, loops, skipped frames and reentrancy; events must not fire unpredictably during editor scrubbing.
13. [ ] **SEQ-013** — Support asynchronous asset readiness and pre-roll without drifting sequence time or producing partially initialized shots.

22. [ ] **SEQ-022** — Provide an extension contract for custom track/channel evaluators with capability and serialization metadata.

#### Authoring, capture, and diagnostics

23. [ ] **SEQ-023** — Provide a minimum timeline authoring surface that can create/edit tracks, sections and keys, scrub time, select bindings, and perform undo/redo; a full Unreal-style editor is not required.
24. [ ] **SEQ-024** — Provide a TypeScript/JSON builder API suitable for code generation, source control and agent authoring.

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Define an editor-independent deterministic sequence asset/evaluator using Three.js tracks and a fixed event-order contract.
2. Mine Theatre.js for binding/editor architecture and select a focused React timeline component for authoring.
3. Use tween/Scene.js primitives internally only where their time/easing semantics match the sequence evaluator exactly.

### This is **not Done** when

- The system is only an `AnimationMixer` wrapper.
- Results depend on how playback arrived at the current timestamp.
- Camera cuts do not reset temporal renderer histories.
- Audio/VFX/events drift or fire inconsistently after seek and loop.
- There is no serializable asset, binding model, nested sequence support or minimum authoring surface.

## F15. Streaming and runtime virtual texturing

**ThreeNative working name:** `VirtualTexturing`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#17 of 20** · **Impact:** 85/100 · **Effort:** 8/10 · **Impact/effort:** 10.6 · **Priority score:** 68.5/100 · **Band:** C — Next  

**Done means:** Materials can address textures larger than physical GPU memory through demand-loaded pages, while runtime virtual textures can cache/composite scene-authored surface data, both under explicit residency, IO and quality budgets.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js provides textures, compressed KTX2 loading, storage textures, render targets and readback primitives. It does not provide offline tiling, page tables, GPU feedback, page scheduling, physical caches, runtime producers, residency or debugging.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-ASSET-001`, `GLOB-RUN-004`, `WorldPartition`, `LayeredMaterials`

### Definition of Done checklist

#### Offline build and runtime asset format

1. [ ] **VT-001** — Tile source images and mip chains into independently addressable pages with configurable page size and filter borders/gutters.
2. [ ] **VT-002** — Preserve color space, channel semantics, alpha, normal-map convention and coordinated material-layer alignment.
3. [ ] **VT-003** — Compress/transcode pages into GPU-supported formats per target tier using KTX2/BasisU or an equivalent documented path.
4. [ ] **VT-004** — Produce a versioned manifest containing virtual dimensions, mip hierarchy, page locations/sizes/checksums, channel groups and fallback tiles.

8. [ ] **VT-008** — Generate GPU feedback identifying required virtual pages and desired mip without stalling the render path.
9. [ ] **VT-009** — Compact/deduplicate feedback and transfer only bounded request data to the streaming scheduler.
10. [ ] **VT-010** — Provide conservative parent/fallback tiles so missing fine pages never sample uninitialized memory or flash arbitrary colors.
11. [ ] **VT-011** — Update page tables atomically relative to uploaded content and prevent references to overwritten/evicted pages.
12. [ ] **VT-012** — Support anisotropic/filter sampling across page and mip boundaries without visible seams from missing gutters or incorrect derivatives.
13. [ ] **VT-013** — Support synchronized multi-channel page groups for base color, normal, roughness/metalness, height and custom masks.

#### Streaming, residency, and budgets

14. [ ] **VT-014** — Prioritize requests by visible footprint, mip error, camera motion, material importance, cell priority and starvation age.
15. [ ] **VT-015** — Load/decode/transcode/upload asynchronously with cancellation and bounded staging memory.
16. [ ] **VT-016** — Enforce physical cache, pending request, IO bandwidth, decode and upload budgets with explicit eviction policy.
17. [ ] **VT-017** — Prefetch parent/neighbor pages and camera-predicted pages enough to reduce visible latency without defeating the budget.
18. [ ] **VT-018** — Handle fast camera motion, teleport, quality changes, device loss and World Partition transitions without stale page-table entries.
19. [ ] **VT-019** — Deduplicate page data across materials/assets when content identity and format allow it.
20. [ ] **VT-020** — Persist disk/network cache according to version/checksum policy and recover safely from corrupt or missing chunks.

#### Runtime virtual textures

21. [ ] **VT-021** — Provide a runtime virtual-texture asset/volume with declared bounds, resolution, layers/channels and producer list.
22. [ ] **VT-022** — Render or compute only dirty/requested runtime pages and invalidate them from producer transform/material/data changes.
23. [ ] **VT-023** — Support deterministic producer ordering/blending for terrain, decals, roads, footprints, landscape data and custom writers.
24. [ ] **VT-024** — Allow materials and gameplay/PCG consumers to sample runtime pages with the same missing-page and quality contract.
25. [ ] **VT-025** — Provide persistence/bake or clear-regenerate policy for runtime-generated data and cell unload/reload.
26. [ ] **VT-026** — Prevent feedback loops where a runtime texture samples itself unless an explicitly staged prior-frame path is used.

#### Integration and diagnostics

27. [ ] **VT-027** — Integrate with layered materials, terrain/water, decals, PCG, HLOD and Virtual Geometry without each system owning a separate incompatible cache.
28. [ ] **VT-028** — Visualize requested/resident/missing pages, mip selection, physical cache, page-table lookup, feedback density, producer ownership and eviction.
29. [ ] **VT-029** — Expose cache occupancy, hit/miss ratio, requested/loaded/evicted pages, IO/decode/upload throughput, latency, fallback sampling and bytes by channel.
30. [ ] **VT-030** — Provide quality controls for page size/build profile, mip bias, anisotropy, cache size, upload budget, prefetch and runtime-update budget.

### Required completion evidence

1. [ ] **VT-EVID-001** — Canonical scenes include huge terrain/material sets, rapid aerial-to-ground movement, repeated textures, normal-map seams, runtime roads/decals/footprints and cell streaming.
2. [ ] **VT-EVID-002** — Golden close-ups validate page borders, anisotropy, mip transitions, normal/material channel alignment and color space.
3. [ ] **VT-EVID-003** — Constrained cache/bandwidth tests prove deterministic fallback/eviction with no uninitialized sampling or stale table references.
4. [ ] **VT-EVID-004** — Fast teleport/device-reset tests recover valid fallback and progressively refine without corruption.
5. [ ] **VT-EVID-005** — Benchmarks separate feedback, CPU scheduling, IO, decode/transcode, upload, page-table update and runtime-page production.

### Repository reuse scan

> These candidates are implementation accelerators, not proof that the feature is Done. License labels are research triage at the snapshot date; re-check the exact pinned commit, submodules, generated code and bundled assets before reuse.

| Candidate | Reuse mode | Fit | License posture | What ThreeNative can borrow | Main caveat |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| [shlomnissan/virtual-textures](https://github.com/shlomnissan/virtual-textures) | FORK / PORT | **5/5** | MIT | Modern virtual-texture page tables, feedback, cache allocation, LRU/residency logic and visualization. | Validate texture formats, page borders, anisotropic filtering and Three.js WebGPU integration at production scale. |
| [BinomialLLC/basis_universal](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal) | ADOPT TOOLCHAIN | **5/5** | Apache-2.0 | GPU texture compression/transcoding, mip processing and compact streamable source assets. | Compression alone is not virtual texturing; integrate page-independent encoding and quality rules. |
| [KhronosGroup/KTX-Software](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software) | ADOPT TOOLCHAIN | **5/5** | Apache-2.0 | KTX2 creation, validation, metadata, mip chains and Basis/UASTC packaging. | Page tiling/manifests and runtime feedback/residency are still ThreeNative-specific. |
| [CesiumGS/cesium](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium) | MINE | **4/5** | Apache-2.0 | Request scheduling, cache eviction, retry, prioritization, memory pressure and diagnostics for streamed resources. | General tiles/resources rather than shader-visible texture page tables. |
| [core-code/LibVT](https://github.com/core-code/LibVT) | REFERENCE / MINE ONLY | **3/5** | No clear reusable license detected | Classic virtual-texturing architecture, feedback buffers, page caches and offline tiling concepts. | Old codebase and unclear license posture; do not copy without confirming rights. |
| [mrdoob/three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) | ADOPT / EXTEND | **4/5** | MIT | Texture loaders, KTX2Loader, compressed textures, storage textures, mip handling and shader sampling integration. | No complete feedback-driven virtual-texture residency layer. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Port `virtual-textures` as the first page-table/cache prototype and share its residency service with VSM and Virtual Geometry.
2. Standardize offline pages on KTX2/Basis tooling with deterministic borders, mips and manifests.
3. Reuse Cesium-style request prioritization and add device-memory-pressure tests before production adoption.

### This is **not Done** when

- Large textures are only manually tiled or loaded as ordinary texture arrays.
- Feedback requires synchronous full-frame readback or stalls rendering.
- Fine-page misses flash black/checkerboard/uninitialized memory instead of valid parents.
- Normals/material channels load at mismatched pages and visibly disagree.
- Runtime producers redraw the entire virtual texture every frame.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] VT-P001** — Fully GPU-resident request scheduling/direct storage paths where native platforms support them.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] VT-P002** — Sparse-residency textures exposed directly by native APIs behind the same contract.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] VT-P003** — Editable persistent virtual texture layers for world painting and user-generated content.

## F10. MetaSounds-like procedural audio

**ThreeNative working name:** `MetaAudio`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#18 of 20** · **Impact:** 70/100 · **Effort:** 5/10 · **Impact/effort:** 14.0 · **Priority score:** 67.0/100 · **Band:** D — Later / specialized  

**Done means:** A versioned, sample-accurate audio graph runs safely on the real-time audio thread, supports reusable DSP nodes and parameters, streams assets, manages voices, integrates spatial audio, and behaves consistently across web and native backends.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js wraps Web Audio listeners and positional sources. Web Audio provides a routing graph and AudioWorklet for custom processing on the rendering thread. ThreeNative still needs a portable graph asset/compiler, DSP library, scheduling, voice/bus system, streaming, native implementation and diagnostics.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-006`, `Sequencer`, `WorldPartition`

#### Assets, voices, and spatial integration

19. [ ] **AUDIO-019** — Stream/decode long audio incrementally with buffering, cancellation, seek and underrun policy; short assets may be predecoded.
20. [ ] **AUDIO-020** — Manage voice limits, priorities, concurrency groups, stealing, virtualization and resume behavior under a hard budget.
21. [ ] **AUDIO-021** — Integrate 3D position, orientation, attenuation, directional cones, Doppler, listener changes and world-origin shifts.
22. [ ] **AUDIO-022** — Support occlusion/reverb-zone/environment inputs through bounded physics or authored queries rather than per-sample scene access.
23. [ ] **AUDIO-023** — Integrate cell streaming so unloaded sources stop/virtualize and resume according to explicit ownership rules.
24. [ ] **AUDIO-024** — Expose asset duration, cue markers, loudness metadata and optional seek tables produced by the build pipeline.

2. [ ] **AUDIO-EVID-002** — Offline golden waveforms verify graph logic, parameter ramps, trigger timing and deterministic random behavior.
3. [ ] **AUDIO-EVID-003** — Real-time stress tests prove no underruns at the declared voice/node target and show p95 callback utilization.
4. [ ] **AUDIO-EVID-004** — Web and native conformance tests compare timing, graph output and lifecycle within declared tolerances.
5. [ ] **AUDIO-EVID-005** — A custom external DSP node demonstrates packaging, validation, compilation and diagnostics.

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Define a backend-neutral immutable DSP graph and validate whether Elementary can serve as its execution core.
2. Use Tone.js as the browser feature/reference layer while implementing native output through cpal or an equivalent backend.
3. Keep Faust optional until its compiler/runtime/generated-code licenses are cleared for ThreeNative distribution.

- The system is only `Audio`/`PositionalAudio` playback or a main-thread Web Audio wrapper.
- Graph updates allocate or block in the real-time callback.
- Timing is frame-based and drifts from the audio clock.
- There is no bounded voice/concurrency policy or long-file streaming.
- Web and native paths share API names but produce undocumented timing/behavior differences.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] AUDIO-P001** — Higher-order ambisonics, HRTF profile selection and room-acoustic simulation.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] AUDIO-P002** — Visual node editor with live waveform/spectrum preview and audition.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] AUDIO-P003** — Audio-rate WASM DSP plugin ABI with ahead-of-time validation on every platform.

## F19. Chaos replacement: modular physics, destruction, cloth, and vehicles

**ThreeNative working name:** `PhysicsSuite`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#19 of 20** · **Impact:** 82/100 · **Effort:** 9/10 as a suite · **Impact/effort:** 9.1 · **Priority score:** 63.4/100 · **Band:** D — Later / specialized  

**Done means:** ThreeNative ships a clearly scoped, cross-platform physics suite: production rigid bodies and queries over Rapier, plus stable destruction, cloth and vehicle modules. Every module shares clocks, transforms, collision policy, budgets, serialization and diagnostics rather than claiming a monolithic Chaos clone.

**Three.js starting point:** The current `@threenative/physics` direction already wraps Rapier and exposes web/WASM and native paths. Rapier provides rigid bodies, colliders, joints, queries, sleeping and nonlinear CCD; the major work is semantic conformance between backend versions plus destruction, cloth, vehicles, rendering integration, tools and module-level acceptance.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-002`, `GLOB-RUN-006`, `WorldPartition`, `Mass`, `VFX`, `Water`, `ControlRig`

### Definition of Done checklist

#### Suite scope and common simulation contract

### Repository reuse scan

> These candidates are implementation accelerators, not proof that the feature is Done. License labels are research triage at the snapshot date; re-check the exact pinned commit, submodules, generated code and bundled assets before reuse.

|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| [dimforge/rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier) | ADOPT CORE | **5/5** | Apache-2.0; verify crate/package grant | Rigid bodies, colliders, joints, character controllers, queries, determinism controls and WASM/native parity base. | ThreeNative must lock cross-backend semantics, serialization, threading and version compatibility. |

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Keep Rapier as the single rigid-body contract and mine react-three-rapier for lifecycle/API ergonomics.
2. Treat cloth/soft bodies, destruction and vehicles as independently shippable modules with separate backends and gates.
3. Port permissive XPBD/fracture algorithms selectively; use PhysX/Jolt/Blast primarily as behavior and benchmark references unless a native-only module is justified.

### This is **not Done** when

- Rapier integration alone is called a Chaos replacement.
- WASM and native packages expose the same names but use incompatible semantics without conformance tests.
- Destruction is preanimated mesh swapping rather than bond/cluster-driven physical fracture.
- Cloth is only vertex animation or lacks collision/LOD/lifecycle.
- Vehicles are simple force scripts with no suspension, tire/slip, drivetrain or telemetry model.
- The suite claims unsupported fluids, flesh, hair or soft bodies by association.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] PHYS-P001** — Ragdoll authoring, active ragdolls and physical animation profiles.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] PHYS-P002** — Tearing cloth, ropes/cables, deformable/soft bodies and flesh.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] PHYS-P003** — GPU fluids, two-way fluid/rigid coupling and large-scale granular simulation.
4. [ ] **[PARITY] PHYS-P004** — Deterministic network rollback and authoritative fracture replication.

## F20. Path tracer and reference renderer

**ThreeNative working name:** `PathTracer`  

**Effort-impact priority:** **#20 of 20** · **Impact:** 60/100 · **Effort:** 9–10/10 · **Impact/effort:** 6.3 · **Priority score:** 46.5/100 · **Band:** D — Later / specialized  

**Done means:** ThreeNative can progressively render physically coherent reference-quality stills and fixed-frame sequences from the same scene/material assets, with robust acceleration, sampling, denoising/AOVs, invalidation and export. Real-time performance is not required for the first Stable release.

**Three.js starting point:** Three.js supplies scene/material data, compute/storage textures and community path-tracing work, but no official production path tracer integrated with the full ThreeNative feature contract. Standard WebGPU requires a software BVH; native hardware RT can be an optional acceleration tier.

**Critical dependencies:** `GLOB-RUN-001`, `LayeredMaterials`, `Sequencer`, `WorldPartition`, `VirtualGeometry`

### Definition of Done checklist

9. [ ] **PT-009** — Support camera and object motion blur for fixed-frame capture when enabled.

12. [ ] **PT-012** — Support multiple diffuse/specular/transmission bounces, Russian roulette, configurable depth and robust path termination.
13. [ ] **PT-013** — Importance-sample environment maps and emissive/area lights, including many-light selection without severe bias.
14. [ ] **PT-014** — Handle HDR energy and fireflies through robust sampling plus optional clamping that is disabled or disclosed for ground-truth comparisons.
15. [ ] **PT-015** — Use deterministic seeded sampling for reproducible tests and distribute samples consistently across tiles/frames.

#### Material and texture parity

16. [ ] **PT-016** — Translate all Layered Material lobes promised for path tracing, including dielectric/conductor, roughness, clearcoat, sheen, anisotropy, emission, transmission and supported subsurface approximation.
17. [ ] **PT-017** — Preserve normal/tangent maps, bump/displacement policy, UV transforms, texture color spaces, filtering and alpha masking.
18. [ ] **PT-018** — Keep material parameter values and light units consistent with the raster renderer so comparisons are meaningful.
19. [ ] **PT-019** — Render a documented fallback for unsupported material nodes and report the object/node instead of silently substituting black.
20. [ ] **PT-020** — Provide a material-conformance scene comparing raster and path-traced spheres/slabs under calibrated lighting.

#### Progressive rendering, denoising, and output

21. [ ] **PT-021** — Accumulate samples progressively with correct running statistics and no precision overflow at long sample counts.
22. [ ] **PT-022** — Invalidate accumulation on any camera, scene, material, light, environment, resolution or relevant setting change.
23. [ ] **PT-023** — Support fixed sample count, time budget, convergence threshold/adaptive sampling and pause/resume.
24. [ ] **PT-024** — Provide optional denoising with albedo/normal/depth/motion or other required guides, while retaining un-denoised output.
25. [ ] **PT-025** — Output beauty plus required AOVs: albedo, normal, depth, direct, indirect, diffuse, specular, emission, variance/sample count and object/material ID.
26. [ ] **PT-026** — Export linear HDR images and selected SDR formats with explicit color transform and metadata.
27. [ ] **PT-027** — Support tiled/high-resolution render and bounded memory for outputs larger than the interactive viewport.
28. [ ] **PT-028** — Integrate Sequencer fixed-frame rendering, temporal shutter sampling, frame naming, resume and failure reporting.

#### Diagnostics and correctness

29. [ ] **PT-029** — Visualize BVH bounds/levels, ray classes, traversal cost, light sampling distribution, path depth, variance, sample count and denoiser guides.
30. [ ] **PT-030** — Expose build/refit time, BVH bytes, rays/s, intersections/ray, samples/pixel, bounce distribution, active tiles, convergence and GPU time.
31. [ ] **PT-031** — Detect NaNs/Infs, invalid PDFs, negative throughput, stack overflow, degenerate triangles and unsupported nodes with contextual diagnostics.
32. [ ] **PT-032** — Provide analytic validation scenes for energy conservation, inverse-square lights, Lambertian response, perfect mirror/refraction, Fresnel, roughness and environment sampling.
33. [ ] **PT-033** — Version the integrator/sampler so golden references are intentionally regenerated when algorithms change.

### Required completion evidence

1. [ ] **PT-EVID-001** — Canonical reference scenes include Cornell-box style diffuse transport, metals, glass/transmission, emissive mesh lighting, environment lighting, DOF, motion blur, instancing and alpha masking.
2. [ ] **PT-EVID-002** — Analytic and furnace tests pass declared numerical/image tolerances and catch material/light unit regressions.
3. [ ] **PT-EVID-003** — Repeated seeded renders are reproducible; unbiased modes converge toward the approved reference as sample count increases.
4. [ ] **PT-EVID-004** — Accumulation invalidation tests mutate every relevant input and prove no stale samples remain.
5. [ ] **PT-EVID-005** — A high-resolution Sequencer render exports the expected frame/AOV set, survives cancellation/resume and stays within the memory budget.
6. [ ] **PT-EVID-006** — Benchmarks separate BVH build/refit, traversal/shading, denoise, readback/export and peak memory on WebGPU and any TN-RT path.

### Repository reuse scan

#### Recommended reuse sequence

1. Adopt three-mesh-bvh plus three-gpu-pathtracer as the immediate validation renderer and golden-scene generator.
2. Prototype a WebGPU backend using Three-PT/speck-pbr patterns while keeping material/scene conversion shared.
3. Use PBRT and Mitsuba images/math as external correctness oracles; do not make full offline-renderer parity a launch blocker.

### This is **not Done** when

- It is a screenshot effect supporting only a subset of Three.js materials.
- Scene/material changes continue accumulating into old samples.
- There is no deterministic sampler, analytic correctness suite or un-denoised output.
- The renderer cannot export HDR/AOVs or run fixed-frame Sequencer capture.
- The implementation assumes browser hardware ray tracing that WebGPU does not expose.

### Parity extensions — valuable, but not required for the first Stable release

1. [ ] **[PARITY] PT-P001** — Spectral rendering, polarization and physically measured camera/sensor response.
2. [ ] **[PARITY] PT-P002** — Bidirectional/path-guided integrators and production light transport features.
3. [ ] **[PARITY] PT-P003** — Distributed rendering and resumable cross-device sample accumulation.

# Cross-system closure

No high-end subsystem is independently Done if its neighboring systems invalidate its result. The following integration requirements must pass before the full **ThreeNative UE5-class stack** can be described as production-ready.

## X1. Renderer integration

1. [ ] **X-RENDER-001** — PostProcessing, TemporalUpscaler, DynamicGI, VirtualShadows, ManyLights, Volumetrics and Water execute through one render graph with declared resource dependencies.
2. [ ] **X-RENDER-002** — LayeredMaterials produces consistent beauty, depth, shadow, motion, ID, GI/reflection and PathTracer behavior for the declared material matrix.
3. [ ] **X-RENDER-003** — VirtualGeometry renders correctly into all promised passes and falls back per object for unsupported geometry/material features.
4. [ ] **X-RENDER-004** — Temporal systems receive one authoritative camera-cut/teleport/origin-shift event and invalidate only their own histories.
5. [ ] **X-RENDER-005** — Dynamic resolution changes propagate coherently to scene attachments, TemporalUpscaler, GI, reflections, volumetrics, post effects and picking.
6. [ ] **X-RENDER-006** — Direct light, shadow, indirect diffuse, reflection, emission, atmosphere and post exposure are energy/composition tested to prevent double counting.
7. [ ] **X-RENDER-007** — Transparent objects, particles, water and volumetrics have a documented ordering and lighting/fog path; no subsystem assumes it is the only transparency consumer.
8. [ ] **X-RENDER-008** — Multiple cameras/render targets do not share temporal histories, page-demand buffers, exposure or culling state accidentally.
9. [ ] **X-RENDER-009** — Device loss and renderer recreation rebuild shared resources in dependency order and leave the scene valid.
10. [ ] **X-RENDER-010** — Debug modes from multiple systems can coexist or explicitly arbitrate without changing shipping output after they are disabled.

## X2. Asset, streaming, and world integration

1. [ ] **X-WORLD-001** — One residency manager arbitrates WorldPartition cells, VirtualGeometry pages, VirtualTexture pages, audio streams and other large resources.
2. [ ] **X-WORLD-002** — Streaming priorities share camera/player prediction and gameplay importance rather than independently saturating IO.
3. [ ] **X-WORLD-003** — Cell activation/deactivation updates render geometry, collision, nav, PCG, Mass, audio, lights, GI representation, shadows, VFX and water in a defined order.
4. [ ] **X-WORLD-004** — HLOD, VirtualGeometry and VirtualTexturing builders share source hashes and do not produce incompatible duplicate proxy data.
5. [ ] **X-WORLD-005** — PCG output has deterministic cell ownership and can generate Mass entities, render instances and collision without per-element React objects.
6. [ ] **X-WORLD-006** — Fast travel cancels obsolete work across every streaming subsystem and prioritizes a coherent minimal playable/visible set.
7. [ ] **X-WORLD-007** — Large-world origin changes update physics, audio, VFX, water, animation, culling and temporal rendering in the same frame contract.
8. [ ] **X-WORLD-008** — Save/load preserves authored and generated gameplay identity without serializing transient GPU cache state.
9. [ ] **X-WORLD-009** — Asset-version mismatch produces a deterministic rebuild/migration/error path instead of partially loading stale runtime data.
10. [ ] **X-WORLD-010** — A combined constrained-memory run proves global budget enforcement and absence of eviction ping-pong between subsystems.

## X3. Animation, simulation, audio, and timeline integration

1. [ ] **X-SIM-001** — MotionMatching selects the base pose; ControlRig/IK layers apply in an explicit order; PhysicsSuite handoff/feedback does not create transform cycles.
2. [ ] **X-SIM-002** — Current and previous transforms/poses are captured after the agreed simulation stages for correct motion vectors and temporal rendering.
3. [ ] **X-SIM-003** — Sequencer can drive camera cuts, animation, rig controls, physics activation, VFX, audio, lights, materials and post effects with deterministic seek behavior.
4. [ ] **X-SIM-004** — MetaAudio schedules Sequencer events against the audio clock and does not depend on render-frame timing.
5. [ ] **X-SIM-005** — VFX and PhysicsSuite exchange bounded collision/damage/spawn events without recursive unbounded spawning.
6. [ ] **X-SIM-006** — Water queries and buoyancy use the physics fixed step while rendered interpolation remains visually synchronized.
7. [ ] **X-SIM-007** — Mass promotes/demotes agents to full scene/physics/animation representations without identity loss or duplicated transforms.
8. [ ] **X-SIM-008** — Pause, time dilation, single-step, background/resume and long frame gaps have a documented effect on each clock domain.
9. [ ] **X-SIM-009** — Capture mode can force deterministic fixed-step animation, physics, VFX, audio-offline rendering and temporal warm-up.
10. [ ] **X-SIM-010** — Cross-system event queues are bounded, observable and tested under overflow.

## X4. Combined production acceptance scene

1. [ ] **X-SCENE-001** — Maintain one redistributable “ThreeNative Production World” containing an interior/exterior transition, dense geometry, layered materials, dynamic sun/local lights, water, fog, VFX, animated characters, crowds and streamed cells.
2. [ ] **X-SCENE-002** — The scene has a versioned deterministic camera/player route, interaction script, quality settings and reference captures.
3. [ ] **X-SCENE-003** — The route exercises day/night lighting, camera cuts, fast travel, destruction, water entry, crowd promotion, VFX bursts, audio zones and world-origin movement.
4. [ ] **X-SCENE-004** — Every feature exposes its counters into one machine-readable capture for the route.
5. [ ] **X-SCENE-005** — The route passes visual-golden, functional-state, GPU-validation, memory, frame-time and streaming-deadline budgets on every declared platform tier.
6. [ ] **X-SCENE-006** — A reduced TN-BASIC route proves graceful degradation and explicit feature fallbacks.
7. [ ] **X-SCENE-007** — The scene can be built and run from a clean checkout with one documented command and no hidden licensed assets.
8. [ ] **X-SCENE-008** — CI stores visual captures, traces, counters and failure diffs as release artifacts.

# Dependency-correct delivery order

The feature sections are sorted by effort-impact score. Actual execution must also respect shared infrastructure and technical dependencies.

## Phase 0 — shared foundations

1. Capability registry and platform-tier contract
2. Shared render graph and scene-data buffers
3. Temporal-history service and authoritative camera-cut/origin-shift events
4. GPU resource/residency manager
5. Versioned asset-build framework and deterministic cache
6. Common diagnostics, benchmark manifest, profiler integration, and golden-test harness
7. Complete motion-vector/depth/normal/material-ID coverage for all supported renderable types

## Phase 1 — highest visual return

1. [`PostProcessing`](#f1)
2. [`Volumetrics`](#f2)
3. [`VFX`](#f3)
4. [`Water`](#f4)
5. Early [`TemporalUpscaler`](#f12) prototype using the shared velocity/history contract

This phase creates the fastest visible quality jump while proving render-graph composition, temporal history, compute workloads, scene attachments, transparency ordering, and declarative effect APIs.

## Phase 2 — image stability, materials, and shadows

1. Production [`TemporalUpscaler`](#f12)
2. [`LayeredMaterials`](#f13)
3. [`VirtualShadows`](#f14), beginning with a VSM-lite directional-light path
4. Minimal [`PathTracer`](#f20) correctness harness for material/light comparison—not its full Stable feature set

These are renderer multipliers: later GI, geometry, water, VFX, and many-light work depend on their correctness.

## Phase 3 — strategic renderer programs

Run these as parallel long-lead programs with explicitly staged closure rather than waiting for one to finish before starting the next:

1. [`VirtualGeometry`](#f17): meshlets → GPU culling → hierarchy/LOD → indirect submission → streaming
2. [`DynamicGI`](#f16): SSGI/SSR baseline → probes/world representation → off-screen contribution → robust denoising
3. [`ManyLights`](#f18): clustered baseline → bounded candidate sampling → scalable visibility/shadows → temporal reconstruction
4. Minimum [`VirtualTexturing`](#f15) page/residency infrastructure required by large-scene assets

## Phase 4 — world scale and procedural population

1. [`PCG`](#f5)
2. [`WorldPartition`](#f8)
3. [`Mass`](#f6)
4. Complete [`VirtualTexturing`](#f15)
5. Individually scoped [`PhysicsSuite`](#f19) modules: destruction, cloth, then vehicles; keep Rapier as the rigid-body core

`PCG`, `WorldPartition`, and `Mass` should share deterministic identity, cell ownership, residency, batching, and representation-LOD contracts rather than creating independent object graphs.

## Phase 5 — character, cinematic, and audio stack

1. [`MotionMatching`](#f9) database/build pipeline and runtime search
2. [`ControlRig`](#f11) solver/constraint stack and retargeting
3. [`Sequencer`](#f7) deterministic timeline, capture, and cross-system tracks
4. [`MetaAudio`](#f10) sample-accurate graph and Sequencer/audio-clock integration

MotionMatching and ControlRig should agree on pose ownership and evaluation order before either is declared Stable.

## Phase 6 — reference renderer and parity extensions

1. Complete the customer-facing [`PathTracer`](#f20)
2. Optional native RT acceleration behind capability flags
3. Advanced fluids, volumetric clouds, deformable geometry, hair/flesh, and other parity extensions
4. Editor-depth tooling once runtime contracts and asset formats are stable

## Parallelization rule

Parallel work is encouraged only where teams share written contracts for scene data, render-graph resources, histories, residency, material evaluation, transforms, and asset ownership. Two attractive prototypes that privately duplicate these foundations increase total effort and do not improve the Done score.

# Final claim policy

ThreeNative may call an individual subsystem **Done** when its global, feature, evidence and applicable cross-system checkboxes pass.

ThreeNative should call the combined stack **UE5-class** only when the combined production scene passes its declared quality, performance, memory and platform targets. That phrase should describe a measured product capability—not the presence of similarly named demos.
