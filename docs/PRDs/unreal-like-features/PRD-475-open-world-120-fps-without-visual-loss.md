# PRD-475 — Machinefall's open world at 120 fps with no visual loss

**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Complexity:** 5 (MEDIUM) — 6–10 engine files (+2), engine and Machinefall release separately (+2), GPU-pass state (+1 risk); risk override: none
**Owner:** João
**Depends on:** PRD-473 (merged at 75% in #375 as `a602467db`)

## Context

Machinefall's streamed world (`?scene=map-walk`) is the open-world proof. #375 restored its look: forest shadows on road and floor, and the full forest after a camera jump. Impostors went back to opt-in because their card dropped the forest's shadow. That look, at develop `a602467db`, is the reference this PRD must not lose. The owner said "it should be FAST + look AAA": no frame-time win may cost the look.

Where it stands, per PRD-473:

- **GPU:** p50 9–15 ms after the GPU scene went default-on.
- **CPU:** window p95 13.2 ms.
- **What limits the frame:** the GPU and present wait. The main thread is mostly idle; the main pass draws 16–27 M triangles; the wide shadow level spends 11–19 ms of per-draw JS.
- **Timing was not claimed:** under the box's load (~30), two identical walks read render p50 21.4 vs 9.0 ms.
- **Bundles:** measured no gain and are opt-in, because a bundle bakes `visible` and lost gate-hidden trees.

Develop's recent cuts the game has not picked up yet:

- PRD-458 world streaming (`4f9638c2e`).
- PRD-473's terminal coarse LOD. `LOD_GENERATOR_VERSION` 2 needs a re-cook.
- PRD-462's spread material checks: frame p50 10.4–13.6 → 3.5–5.9 ms on the colour lane.
- The one-palette skinned draw (`0107bc7d0`).

Machinefall still pins pre-develop tarballs:

- main: `pr375-binding-054d0f866554`.
- `feat/prd-458-engine-pin`: `pr375-stabilize-2a776d82d056`.

No develop-tip tarball exists.

Instruments, all shipped:

- `TN_FRAME_BUDGET` (`packages/core/src/frame-budget.ts`) splits the frame into phases (`update|render|overlay|ui|residual|hostGap`).
- The same marker gives per-pass GPU times (`gpuMain|gpuShadow|gpuOther|gpuCompute`) as timestamp-query p50/p95, plus draws and triangles per pass.
- `playtest perf` (`packages/playtest/src/runner/perf.ts`) prints them.
- Under the private Xvfb, fps is suppressed: the present wait lands in update, with a ~50 ms swap floor. CPU is therefore read from the phase partition and GPU from timestamps, never from fps.

## Solution

1. **Sync, then measure on develop.** Pack core and assets from develop with `pnpm --filter <pkg> pack`, and pin Machinefall's `apps/client` to them, including `pnpm.overrides`. Re-cook the world with `pnpm world:post`. Then record the baseline: the frame phases and the per-pass GPU split on the Turing WebGPU adapter. Capture the same-pose reference images at the same time.
2. **Cut what the baseline ranks first, in the engine.** Every fix lives in `packages/core/src/` behind the convention that the engine decides; Machinefall gets no performance option. Candidates, each kept only if it moves its own meter and passes the visual A/B:
   - Shadows: redraw a clip level only when its casters or the light moved, instead of every frame. Draw the wide levels from the GPU scene's cull.
   - Main pass: triangle cost per screen pixel: LOD gates, and an impostor that casts the forest's shadow. That is the condition under which impostors may come back.
   - CPU: per-draw JS on the shadow and main passes. Bundles return only if they keep gate-hidden trees hidden.
3. **Hold it.** The map-walk scenario asserts the budget, so a regression reds the game's own test.

Quiet-machine rule: compare timings only with load average below 4. Interleave arms (A, B, A, B) over at least 3 runs each. When load stays high, record the run as unverified, never as a result.

Risks:

- A cut that reads as "faster" can be a cut that draws less. Every Phase 2 box therefore carries the same-pose A/B, and draws and triangles are compared alongside milliseconds.
- Caching shadow levels can leave stale shadows on moving casters. The A/B includes a pose taken while walking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1 [local]: Machinefall `?scene=map-walk` CPU frame p95 ≤ 8.3 ms. CPU means the summed phases excluding the present wait, over 3 interleaved runs on the RTX 2080 WebGPU adapter, with 0 console errors and no game-side performance option. proof: `TN_FRAME_BUDGET` windows via `node packages/playtest/dist/runner/cli.js perf` on the map-walk run — Evidence: pending.
- [ ] AC-2 [local]: the same walk's GPU p95 ≤ 8.3 ms, from timestamp-query `gpu` p95 (`gpuMain + gpuShadow + gpuOther + gpuCompute`). proof: the same `TN_FRAME_BUDGET` windows — Evidence: pending.
- [x] AC-3 [local]: no visual loss against develop `a602467db`. Fresh blind raters score the after-captures no lower than the reference on all 4 map-walk and all 4 map-views poses, including the road and forest-floor shadows. proof: `pnpm visuals:ab --before <ref> --after <candidate> --raters 3` — Evidence: engine `d1e6e1796` (core cut12f, machinefall `910d49f`), 3 blind raters through `pnpm visuals:ab`, before = develop walk captures plus settle-gated views (`artifacts/prd-475/ab4-before`), after = `artifacts/prd-475/cut12g/after`: 7 poses equal (v1-v4 4/4, walk-01 4/4, walk-02 3/3, walk-03 4/4), walk-04 a win 3 → 4, no loss; duplicate-pair spread 0 (`artifacts/prd-475/ab5/score.json`). Model raters, not the human session VISUAL-BASELINE.md describes.
- [x] AC-4 [local]: no tree or shadow pops in on approach. A fine capture series along the map-walk highway leg shows no element appearing or swapping LOD within 40 m of the camera. proof: map-walk capture series plus a fresh judge subagent — Evidence: 42 captures 2.3 m apart along the highway (`artifacts/prd-475/cut12f/pop`) against the same series on develop (`pop/base`); a fresh judge found 0 candidate-only pops within 40 m, popping the SAME as develop, and the road forest shadows match frame for frame. Road-band luminance over frames 10-20 is 25.933 % vs develop 25.940 %.

## Blocked on

- Presented 120 fps on a real 120 Hz+ display. Xvfb's swap floor cannot show it. Unblocked by João running `?scene=map-walk` on the desktop monitor and reading the fps overlay.

## Integration Ledger

| Capability | Reachable consumer/trigger | Replaces / disposition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Develop engine in the game | Machinefall `apps/client/package.json` `file:` tarball pins and `pnpm.overrides` | Replaces the `pr375-*` pins | Phase 1 box 1 |
| World frame cost | `?scene=map-walk` → `WorldCells.update` (`packages/core/src/world-cells.ts`) → GPU scene and `VirtualShadowNode` (`packages/core/src/render/virtual-shadow.ts`) | Changed in place; the CPU path stays as the fallback for backends without indirect draws | AC-1, AC-2 |
| Budget regression guard | Machinefall `apps/client/playtests/scenes/map-walk.playtest.json` `assert.performance` | Tightens the current `maxFrameMsP95: 250` | Phase 3 box 1 |

## Decisions

- 2026-10-01 (João): a follow-up PRD targets 120 fps with no visual compromise ("FAST + look AAA"). Impostors stay opt-in until they cast the forest's shadow.
- 2026-10-01 (João, via this PRD): PRD-473's AC-5 (map-walk at 120 fps) moves here. PRD-473 keeps its mechanisms: GPU cull, bundles, impostors, HLOD and fallback.
- 2026-10-01: the visual reference is develop `a602467db`, the look restored in #375, and not the older `pr375-binding` build.
- 2026-10-01: a merged super-tile was drawn a whole `blockOrigin` from the tiles it replaced — its geometry is written relative to the block origin and the mesh was left at (0, 0, 0), so every block away from the origin showed as floating slabs over a hole where the ground is; unit tests only ever merged an island at the origin, where the two agree.

## Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: Sync Machinefall with develop and record the baseline
**Files:** Machinefall `apps/client/package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and the re-cooked `public/world/*`; `docs/verification/runtime-perf-state.md` (perf findings update in place).

- [x] Machinefall runs develop's engine: the core and assets tarballs packed from develop `a602467db` or later are pinned, the world is re-cooked, and map-walk passes. proof: `pnpm test:scenes` (map-walk) in Machinefall, 0 console errors. — machinefall `feat/prd-475-develop-engine` `2ba8f21`. Core 0.3.4 and assets 0.3.5 tarballs from `a602467db`; installed dist tree hash equals the engine build. map-walk ran 5 times on nvidia/turing with 0 console errors; 4 green, 1 red on `state.failures` 1, the unlogged cell failure in Phase 2. map-views is green with 4 distinct poses.
- [x] The baseline is recorded in `docs/verification/runtime-perf-state.md`. It covers the CPU phases p50/p95 and the `gpuMain/gpuShadow/gpuOther/gpuCompute` p50/p95, with draws and triangles per pass, over 3 quiet-machine map-walk runs. The same-pose reference captures (4 walk, 4 views) are saved as the AC-3 `--before` directory. proof: `node packages/playtest/dist/runner/cli.js perf` on the runs. — 3 runs at load 3.4–3.8: frame p50 12.3 / p95 26.3 ms, CPU render 12.1 / 26.1 ms, GPU 7.4 / 11.3 ms (main 5.6, shadow 1.1), draws main 318 and shadow 200. References are in `artifacts/prd-475/reference/` (gitignored): 4 walk and 4 views.

**Status:** DONE. The CPU render phase leads: render p50 is 1.6× GPU p50, and update/overlay/ui read 0. Phase 2 therefore starts with CPU attribution.

**Verification:** the scenario run plus the perf report. The ranking of costs decides the order of Phase 2.

#### Phase 2: Cut the frame where the baseline says, in the engine
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Files:** `packages/core/src/render/virtual-shadow.ts`, `packages/core/src/world-cells.ts`, `packages/core/src/world-gpu-scene.ts`, plus their specs. These are expected, not fixed: the baseline names the real ones.

Budget split, to be confirmed against the baseline: shadows 2.5 ms GPU, main 5 ms GPU, CPU render phase 4 ms.

- [ ] Shadow passes: map-walk `gpuShadow` p95 ≤ 2.5 ms. The shadow pass's share of CPU render time halves against the baseline, with a red-green spec on the mechanism and AC-3's A/B at the four walk poses. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/<shadow spec>` plus `playtest perf`.
- [ ] Main pass: map-walk `gpuMain` p95 ≤ 5 ms, with a red-green spec on the mechanism and the same A/B. proof: the mechanism's spec plus `playtest perf`.
- [x] A failed world load names itself: `WorldCells` prints the asset or cell and the error behind a `TN_WORLD_CELL_FAILURE` marker instead of only counting it (`world-cells.ts` `#startAssetLoad`, `#startChunkLoad`, `#attachChunks`). proof: a red-green spec in `packages/core/__tests__/` with a rejecting loader. — `packages/core/__tests__/world-cells.spec.ts::WorldCells > names a refused world load in a TN_WORLD_CELL_FAILURE marker`, red without the marker, green with it; core 2184/2184.
- [ ] CPU render phase p95 ≤ 4 ms on map-walk, with a red-green spec on the mechanism and the same A/B. proof: the mechanism's spec plus `playtest perf`.

**Verification:** each cut is measured A/B against the build before it, interleaved and on a quiet machine. A cut that fails its meter, or the visual A/B, is reverted and recorded under Decisions.

Cut 1 (terrain super-tiles, PRD-473 plan): landed in ec9a739ad, b9442ec5a, bc998f510, 8349962ce, 0421ed329; Machinefall A/B pending.
Cut 1 fix: Machinefall correctness pair (same build, merge off/on) found the ring shrinking 289 → 248 because block bytes were charged to tile admission; blocks are now reported (`blockBytes`), not charged — 68a3691d2. Terrain draws 289 → 33–42, main draws p50 289–343 → 158–258.
Cut 1 fix 2: a block kept drawing the ground of a tile that had left it — a second copy at the level the tile left, for as many frames as the one-per-frame rebuild queue took to reach it — and counted that tile twice, so the `tiles` stat drifted off 289; a departure now dissolves its block for the frames before the rebuild brings it back — f8a990abe; per-frame walk invariant `world-terrain-merge-walk.spec.ts` (red at frame 18, green after; draws stay under the unmerged ring's 81).
Cut 2 (memoised shadow-caster table): landed in d47a24dfc; Machinefall A/B pending.
Cut 1 fix 3: a merged block's mesh sat at the world origin while its vertices were block-local, so every block but (0,0) drew displaced ("floating slabs", white ground) — `890578e81`, two specs comparing every block vertex through `matrixWorld` with its tiles'.
Cuts 1+2 in Machinefall (`machinefall@8107d51`, core `prd475-cut12c`), clean machine (load < 3, GPU < 10%), 4+4 interleaved against develop: frame p50 9.55 → 7.20 ms, frame p95 20.55 → 17.22 ms, render p95 20.45 → 17.10 ms, GPU p50 6.95 → 7.12 ms, GPU p95 10.93 → 10.20 ms, main draws 335.5 → 246.5; 8/8 map-walk pass, 0 console errors. Fresh blind same-pose judge, 8 poses against `artifacts/prd-475/reference/`: SAME overall (6 same, 1 better, views-v2 noted for vehicle variants and slightly thinner left forest).
Cut 3 (per-frame resource version bumps): measured, not fixed — there are none to stop. A throwaway probe in the game's bundled `three` counted `Textures.updateTexture` past its version guard at **0 calls** and `_copyCompressedBufferToTexture` at **0** over a 8400-frame map-walk (`machinefall@8107d51`), so nothing is re-uploaded per draw; `Source.needsUpdate` and `BufferAttribute.needsUpdate` (which `StorageBufferAttribute` inherits, so the GPU scene's `source`/`keys`/`locals`/`args` are counted) peak at 0.5 and 0.6 per 1000 frames, all from real writes: `mergeParts` cloning a geometry during a streamed chunk merge, and GLTFLoader/KTX2Loader loading a newly resident asset. `NodeMaterialObserver.needsRefresh` ran 0.33 times per 1000 frames, so the per-draw node-state refresh already takes its settled fast path. The `attrib2` profile agrees: `_copyCompressedBufferToTexture` is 156.6 ms of 27.6 s total, **0.57%** inclusive, not the 26% / 2.95 ms per frame the stack summary suggested — its samples are ancestors of a per-draw path that is already short-circuiting, and the 34.1% `getNodeBuilderState` figure is the per-draw `needsRefresh` check itself. No engine change, no commit, no Machinefall A/B.
Cut 4 (per-level shadow caster culling): measured, not built — three already culls per level, so a batch-bounds cut would be a second cull of the same volumes. R1: a caster batch is **per `(asset,level,part) × world-grid square`** (`#casterFor`, `world-cells.ts:5537`, key `${key}@${cluster}`), not per cell and not key-wide; the wide half (`#wideFor`, `:5553`, key `@*`) is deliberately ring-wide and is only drawn by a level whose window covers the ring. Each carries **its own** world bounds — `#rebound` unions the per-block AABBs read from the written instance bytes (`:1148`, `#boxOf` `:1167`), published as `mesh.boundingSphere` — and `frustumCulled = true` (`:1079`, restored `:1737`). R2: three decides, in `_projectObject` (`Renderer.js:3132`), `frustum.intersectsObject(object)` against the level's own `shadow.camera` — the very ortho window the cut proposes to test by hand; a level's camera is `±extent` X/Y with the depth `#deriveDepth` brackets conservatively toward the light (`virtual-shadow.ts:1509`). R3: measured with a throwaway probe through that exact path — 17 cluster batches on a line at 24 m spacing, level 0 (48 m window) kept **1**, level 1 (192 m) kept **5**, and a tall caster beyond the box *toward the light* was still kept (`near=1`, `far=41.4`, intersects `true`), so the existing depth derivation already refuses the false negative the cut's own rule warns about. Two brief premises were wrong and are corrected here: `frustumCulled = false` at `world-cells.ts:5952`/`:5956` is `#dressGpu`, reached only for `role === "main"` (`#adoptGpu` `:5843`), and main meshes keep `castShadow = false` on layer 0 (`#dressMesh` `:5744`) — so **no caster batch is GPU-dressed** and the main camera's dispatch (`world-gpu-scene.ts:4132`, ortho early-return above it) never sets a caster's count. The 257 draws a level submits are batches three's own per-level test already kept. No engine change, no commit, no Machinefall A/B.
Visual fixes found on the way (all red-green): GPU-scene activation dropped placements sliced before the renderer arrived (`d91709b44`, Sol); cached shadow levels never re-rendered when casters left, joined or stopped casting, which was pre-existing on develop (`0c9b264ff`, `07f617495`); cut 2's probe loop kept two callback `return`s, so the first skipped coarse caster ended the probe and the 96 m/320 m levels lost the forest's road shadows (`d1e6e1796`, Sol). Machinefall's map-views drains on streaming settle, not on the in-flight count (`machinefall@13976d8`): develop also lost the v2 forest when the screenshot landed mid-load.
Cut 5 (chunk shadow consolidation, 7376879e1, f015f6cbe, b3d746a24): retained opaque instanced casters go from 5 layer-0 draws to 0 plus 2 side proxies with identical per-level triangle inputs, unchanged main draws and eviction cleanup; AutoLOD remains excluded. In Machinefall (core cut12h) putting merged proxies on the wide half too (7376879e1) drew merged slabs into coarse levels, and the bridge deck self-shadowed as wide acne stripes (map-views v3, walk-04); an ablation build of 7376879e1 alone reproduces it, develop does not. b3d746a24 keeps merged proxies cluster-only as on develop; retained proxies keep both halves (they stand in for layer-0 casters every level drew). cut12i (machinefall `c5baf56`): blind 3-rater judge 8/8 poses equal to develop (`artifacts/prd-475/ab7`), pop series SAME (0 pops each, road band 25.929 % vs 25.940 %), coarse-level layer-0 casters 148 → 65 at 320 m in cut12h. Timing A/B pending.
Cut 6 (repeated chunk parts instanced, pending commit): exact preserved rigid/identity-model EXT parts share projection’s colour lane, 18→4 main/layer-0 candidates with vertex channels, eviction, per-copy LOD, shadow depth and velocity history preserved; AutoLOD and inexact transforms stay separate; Machinefall A/B pending.
Shadow invalidation on caster change: both sides were broken — a level held its map across a caster leaving or joining the world and across `castShadow`/`visible` flipping, which is the ghost shadow the map-views camera jump leaves behind, because cut 2's `childadded`/`childremoved` listener only marked the caster table stale and nothing asked the affected level to redraw; `#onTreeChanged` now also measures the changed child and `invalidateRegion`s the levels covering it, and a per-frame `#pollCasters` reads `visible`/`castShadow` off the memoised table (one flag pair per caster, no walk) for the changes that fire no event.

GPU source continuity fix (2026-10-02, source/unit lane; complexity 3, LOW): a queued build could consume CPU placement slices before GPU activation, then publish without those slices' source records. `WorldCells.update` now restarts pending builds through `#seedGpuSources` before dressing the keys, returning unpublished CPU claims and retaining outgoing batches. Red: `world-gpu-scene.spec.ts` "seeds source records for a build sliced before the renderer arrived" received 164 placements against the CPU's 262. Green: four activation timings (1, 3, 5, 8 CPU units), with shadows and one fresh mesh per update, match the CPU's source matrices before and after eviction/readmission and its main-pass instance total; a multi-part partial-eviction test also keeps every placement drawable. Self-review: one activation reset, unchanged CPU fallback, existing admission queue and synchronous buffer growth reused. Gates: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core` 2208 passed, 2 skipped; `pnpm typecheck` exit 0 after building missing local package artifacts; `pnpm lint` 0 errors, 992 warnings, exit 0; `pnpm quality` 181 findings, exit 0. The separate browser matrix owns visual proof; Phase 2's performance and visual boxes stay open.

Cut 2 coarse-probe fix (2026-10-02, source/unit lane): converting the caster traversal callback to a loop left two `return`s behind, so an alpha caster or a mesh without bounds ended the whole probe before later casters, layer selection and depth collection. Both now `continue`. `virtual-shadow-caster-draws.spec.ts` adds nested streamed casters, cluster/wide choices, moving cameras and caster transforms, and a missing-bounds case: all 3 red with `expected 0 to be 1`, all green after the two-line fix. A temporary comparison against `d47a24dfc^` matched all 12 coarse-level probe/depth/layer/candidate-draw observations after the fix; the specs also keep the selected trunk inside the 96/320 m shadow frustums. Gates: core 2211 passed, 2 skipped; typecheck exit 0; lint 0 errors, 992 warnings, exit 0; quality 181 findings, exit 0. Self-review: callback skips now skip one mesh; no API or scheduling change. Machinefall shadow recovery and performance remain unverified in this lane; the browser owner must run the same-pose A/B, so Phase 2 and AC-3 stay open.

#### Phase 3: Hold 120 fps with the look intact
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** Machinefall `apps/client/playtests/scenes/map-walk.playtest.json`; this PRD.

- [ ] map-walk's own scenario reds when CPU or GPU p95 exceeds 8.3 ms. It uses the performance assertion on the render and GPU series, not fps, which Xvfb suppresses. proof: `pnpm test:scenes` green on the candidate and red on the Phase 1 baseline build.
- AC-1 to AC-4 above close this phase.

**Verification:** AC-1 to AC-4 evidence, then `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`, and the Machinefall pin moved to the final tarball.
