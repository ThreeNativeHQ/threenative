# Repo grounding for the UE5 feature research

**Filed 2026-08-30, measured at `6adb26d4`.** Read this before either checklist document in this
folder. The checklists were written without access to this tree: they are a good statement of *what
"Done" means* for a UE5-class subsystem, and an unreliable statement of *what ThreeNative still has
to build*. This file supplies the second half — what already ships, what is already filed, and which
proposals the charter has already closed.

Nothing here weakens the checklists' Definition of Done. A feature that ships here still owes the
same evidence. What changes is the starting line.

## 1. Three defects in the research as filed

**(a) Two of the three files are the same document.**
`threenative-ue5-feature-checklists-and-repo-scan.md` (2,781 lines) and
`threenative-ue5-feature-checklists-and-repository-reuse-map.md` (2,973 lines) share the same
title, version, snapshot date, F-numbering, ranking table, Definition of Done and phase plan.
Ignoring whitespace they differ by 568 lines in one direction and 760 in the other — the reuse-map
adds the *Repository-reuse decision framework* (license markers ✅/⚠️/⛔/🧊) and longer per-feature
repo prose. **Keep the reuse-map, delete the repo-scan**, or the folder ships two rankings of the
same twenty features and a reader has no way to know which one moved. Two copies of a score is two
scores.

**(b) Several features are already in the tree, so their effort estimates are wrong.**
The research ranks F17 (virtualized geometry) at effort 8–9/10 and puts it in band B — Strategic. It
landed on 2026-08-30 and is on by default (`e69c737f`); the bake, the cluster DAG and the runtime
cut are in `packages/assets/src/virtual/` (1,313 lines) and `packages/core/src/clustered-mesh.ts` +
`clustered-batch.ts` (957 lines), and the batch that produced it closed seven PRDs with two of them
**declined on measured headroom** rather than unbuilt. Section 3 does this for all twenty.

**(c) It does not apply the charter's filter, so four of its recommendations are unbuildable here.**
The binding test is not impact-over-effort. It is the two questions: *could the game write this
portably itself*, and *does it decide how anything looks*. The second is a veto over the first —
anything that decides how it looks ships as generated user source in a template's `src/render/`, at
any size, no matter how strategic. On top of that, the charter closes an ECS, an editor, a preset
system, a scene format, an IR and a bespoke CLI vocabulary **with evidence**, and says each can
absorb the entire company. The research recommends `hmans/miniplex` for F6 and
`theatre-js/theatre` for F7 without knowing either question was already settled.

## 2. Two facts the research could not know, and both change the plan

### The render chain already exists, and it is the spine every A-band feature assumed had to be built

`packages/core/src/render/chain.ts` (598 lines) ships an ordered, tiered, self-reporting post
stack:

```text
ambientOcclusion · ssgi · godRays · ssr · denoise · temporalReproject · taa · traa ·
motionBlur · sharpen · bloom · vignette · lensDistortion · sparkle · gradualBackground
```

with `high | medium | low | off` tiers carrying real parameters (denoise iterations, slice count,
step count), an `auto` request path, an MRT-or-per-object velocity source with a rejection
measurement, dropped-stage reporting, a frame-budget window, and a `TN_RENDER_CHAIN` marker that
playtests and the native diagnostics both read. F1, F2, F12 and F16 in the research are all
specified as if this had to be designed. It does not: they are **stages plugged into a chain that
already names the tier it ran**. That is a different, much smaller piece of work, and it is why the
A-band effort numbers should not be trusted as filed.

The individual nodes — `SSGINode`, `SSRNode`, `DenoiseNode`, `TRAANode`, `TemporalReprojectNode`,
`SharpenNode`, `SSAAPassNode`, `VelocityNode` — live in
`packages/create-threenative/templates/starter/src/render/worldEnvironment.ts`, i.e. **as generated
game source**, which is where the charter requires anything that decides how it looks to live. Only
the `starter` template has that file today; the other six ship `postprocessing.ts` and no
`worldEnvironment.ts`. That gap is PRD-278, first tranche landed.

### There are 5,476 lines of hardware ray tracing in the native host, deliberately switched off

`packages/runtime-native/src/raytracing/` implements BLAS/TLAS construction and `traceRays` across
**DXR (1,276 lines), Vulkan (1,540) and Metal (864)**, with HLSL, GLSL and Metal raygen/closesthit/
miss shaders and precompiled DXIL and SPIR-V headers, exposed to JS as a `mystralRT` global
(`isSupported`, `getBackend`, `createGeometry`, `createBLAS`, `createTLAS`, `updateTLAS`,
`traceRays`).

It refuses on purpose. `isSupported()` returns `false` and `traceRays()` throws
`TN_NATIVE_RAYTRACING_UNAVAILABLE` before backend dispatch, gated by PRD-198 behind **one named
missing piece: buffer-to-texture copy-out interop**
([verification](../../verification/prd-198-raytracing-gated-2026-08-25.md)). No code in
`packages/core` reaches it; the only references outside the implementation are the refusal
contract, a conformance refusal scene, and the capability manifest's constraint line.

This matters to three of the research's features at once. F16 (Lumen-like), F18 (MegaLights) and
F20 (path tracer) are all costed as software problems on WebGPU, because the research assumes
WebGPU is the only backend. Here, **the native arm already has the hardware path written**, and one
interop seam stands between the tree and a ray-traced native lane. It also mirrors the charter's
"a feature that works on web only is unfinished" in the other direction: a native-only capability
with no portable seam is the same defect, and this one is not currently reachable from any game.

## 3. Grounding table — all twenty features against this tree

**Verdict** applies the charter: *mechanism* ships in `packages/`, *look* ships as generated source
in a template's `src/render/`, *closed* means already decided with evidence and not reopened in a
feature.

| F | UE label | In this tree today | Filed | Verdict | The real remaining gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F17 | Nanite-like | **Shipped, on by default** — `clustered-mesh.ts`, `clustered-batch.ts`, bake DAG in `packages/assets/src/virtual/` | PRD-279…285: 4 done, 1 partly (GPU cut on native), 2 declined on measured headroom | mechanism | The GPU cut on native (PRD-283). Occlusion and streaming were **declined on the measured headroom**, not skipped — reopening needs a new measurement, not a proposal |
| F1 | Post-processing | **Shipped** — `RenderChain` + per-template `postprocessing.ts`; realism-effects coverage tracked by `scripts/realism-effects-coverage.ts` | PRD-011, PRD-273 | look → templates | Six of seven templates have no `worldEnvironment.ts` (PRD-278 tranche 2). Not a package |
| F16 | Lumen-like GI | **Partly** — `SSGINode`/`SSRNode`/`DenoiseNode` in starter source; baked static light done (PRD-256) | PRD-266…270 **all PROPOSED**, PRD-245 PROPOSED | mixed: nodes are look, velocity/probe transport is mechanism | The batch is filed and unexecuted. PRD-270 ("no lighting node ships web-only") is the charter rule made into a gate — execute that batch before proposing anything new here |
| F12 | Temporal upscaling | **Partly** — `traa`/`temporalReproject` stages, `resolution-scaler.ts` (280 lines, `resolutionScale: "auto"`), `render/batched-velocity.ts` | PRD-259 **declined at Phase 0**; PRD-269 (motion vectors) PROPOSED | mechanism | No upscaler, and PRD-269 is its precondition: skinned and instanced geometry have no motion vectors, so every temporal stage above is lying on animated content. **Fix the velocity source before adding a consumer of it** |
| F14 | Virtual Shadow Maps | **Nothing** — templates use ordinary `shadowMap`; no CSM, no cascades, no page table | none | mechanism | Genuine greenfield, and the largest single fidelity gap in the manifest. Shares page-table and dirty-tracking machinery with F17, which just shipped |
| F18 | MegaLights / many lights | **Nothing** — no clustered or tiled light path anywhere in `packages/` | none | mechanism | Genuine greenfield. On native it could ride `mystralRT`; on web it cannot, so it must be specified two-tier from the start or it violates PRD-270's rule |
| F3 | Niagara-like VFX | **Partly** — `GPUParticles3D` (`particles.ts`), `TracerPool3D`, `FluidField2D`, `Billboard3D`, `SpriteAnimator3D` | PRD-027 done | mechanism, and `GPUParticles3D` is the charter's cited example of a legal one | No module/graph authoring layer. Careful: the graph must not decide appearance — geometry, material, colour, curve and timing stay the game's |
| F13 | Substrate materials | **Shipped as game source** — per-template `materials.ts` | PRD-011 | **look → templates** | Not a package, at any size. A layered-material *package* is the exact shape v1 shipped and measured worse than vanilla |
| F5 | PCG | **Partly** — `PRD-251 procedural world fields` Phase 1 complete, Phases 2–6 unexecuted; terrain done (PRD-043) | PRD-251 in `feature-mining/HIGH` | mechanism, but adjacent to the closed preset/editor question | Finish the filed PRD before importing a new framework. A node-graph PCG *authoring UI* is an editor and is closed |
| F8 | World Partition / HLOD | **Partly** — `PRD-253 content residency and screen-space HLOD` is **BLOCKED at Phase 0** on a portable native residency consumer | PRD-253, PRD-098 (LOD/instancing) **declined 2026-08-22** | mechanism | Blocked on a consumer, not on an algorithm. 3DTilesRendererJS does not unblock it |
| F15 | Virtual Texturing | **Partly** — KTX2/Basis transcoding shipped (PRD-095), model-internal textures compressed; `packages/assets/src/passes/` | PRD-095 done; PRD-099 vector textures **declined** | mechanism | Compression exists; there is no runtime page table, feedback buffer or residency cache. Note the BC7 block rule: every source texture must be divisible by 4 |
| F4 | Water | **Shipped, web only** — `packages/core/src/ocean/{spectral,fft}.ts`, `SpectralOcean` | PRD-246 done, **"web only, with named gaps"** | mechanism | **This is an open charter violation**, not a feature gap: a web-only capability is unfinished. It owes one native conformance case, which the PRD names and did not add |
| F19 | Physics suite | **Partly** — `@threenative/physics` (Rapier: bodies, colliders, joints, character controller, queries, layers, navigation); `SoftBody3D` cloth-first shipped 2026-08-30 (PRD-243) and clears the kill switch by 16× | PRD-040, 046, 243 done | mechanism | No destruction, no vehicles. Rapier is already adopted — the research's "adopt Rapier" is done |
| F9 | Motion Matching | **Nothing**; `animation.ts` (379 lines) is a clip/state player, `PRD-039` animation state machine closed WONTBUILD with recorded reopen triggers | none | mechanism | Greenfield, and gated on rigged assets — the same trigger PRD-039 records. Do not file it before those triggers fire |
| F11 | Control Rig / IK | **Nothing** — `skeleton.ts` is 46 lines (`attachToBone`, `skeletonBones`); `GroundSnap` handles feet-to-floor | none | mechanism | Greenfield. Smaller than the research implies because the bone seam and the grounding convention exist |
| F6 | Mass / ECS crowds | `PRD-258 many actors share one animation texture` is **BLOCKED at Phase 0** on a runnable many-soldier consumer | PRD-258 | **closed** — a code-first ECS is closed with evidence and not reopened in a feature | The crowd *rendering* path (animation texture) is legal and blocked on a consumer. The ECS half is not on the table. Do not adopt miniplex |
| F7 | Sequencer | **Partly** — `AnimationPlayer`, `PathFollow3D`, `CameraShake`, and `PRD-241 a sequence is one cancellable object` (done) | PRD-241 | runtime sequencing is mechanism; **a timeline editor is closed** | The cancellable-sequence primitive shipped. Theatre.js is an editor; adopting it reopens a closed question |
| F10 | Procedural audio | **Partly** — `audio.ts` (456 lines), `AudioBus`, native audio parity lane (PRD-057) | PRD-057 | mechanism | No DSP graph. Lowest-ranked A–C item and it stays there |
| F20 | Path tracer | **The native hardware path is written and gated** (§2) | PRD-198 | mechanism | Not "build a path tracer". It is *one interop seam*: buffer-to-texture copy-out. That is a far smaller and better-defined item than the research's 9–10/10 effort |

## 4. The re-rank the charter produces

Five, ranked. Anything that ships here still owes the checklists' Definition of Done and a playtest
scenario, and — per the charter — proof on native in the same commit.

| # | Item | Why it ranks here rather than where the research put it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **PRD-269 — motion vectors for skinned and instanced geometry** | The chain already runs `traa`, `temporalReproject`, `ssgi`, `ssr` and `motionBlur`. Every one of them is temporal, and on animated content their velocity input is wrong. This is not a new feature; it is the correctness bug under five shipped stages, and it is the precondition for F12 |
| 2 | **Execute the filed lighting batch (PRD-266…270)** | Filed, PROPOSED, unexecuted, and PRD-270 encodes the charter rule that no lighting node ships web-only. Executing a filed batch beats opening a new one |
| 3 | **F14 Virtual Shadow Maps** | The largest true greenfield gap, pure mechanism, no charter tension, and it inherits page-table and dirty-tracking machinery from the virtual geometry that landed on 2026-08-30 |
| 4 | **F4's native conformance case** | One case closes a standing charter violation. Cheapest row in this table by a wide margin |
| 5 | **PRD-198's buffer-to-texture copy-out interop** | Unblocks 5,476 already-written lines and changes the shape of F16, F18 and F20 at once. Scope it as an interop seam, not as a renderer |

Deliberately **not** in this list: F6 ECS and F7's editor (closed with evidence), F13 and F1 as
packages (look, so they ship as template source), F9 (waiting on its recorded rigged-asset trigger),
and F8 and F6's crowd path (blocked on consumers, not on algorithms — find the consumer first).

## 5. What to do with this folder

1. Delete `threenative-ue5-feature-checklists-and-repo-scan.md`; keep the reuse-map, which is a
   superset with license triage.
2. Keep `threenative-repository-borrowing-catalog.md` as filed. It is the most directly useful of
   the three, and its license posture column is the part this repo cannot regenerate cheaply. Two
   entries are already settled in-tree and should be marked so: `dimforge/rapier` is adopted, and
   `zeux/meshoptimizer`'s territory is covered by the shipped cluster DAG.
3. Treat both remaining documents as **requirement checklists**, never as a queue. This file, the
   capability manifest (`packages/create-threenative/capabilities.json`, 197 entries, regenerated by
   `pnpm build`) and the PRD folders are the queue.
