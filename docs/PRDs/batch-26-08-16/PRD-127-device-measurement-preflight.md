# PRD-127 — One device lane checks the phone's condition and three do not

**Status:** PROPOSED, 2026-08-16. Nothing below has executed. No device number is revised by this
file, and no mobile readiness is claimed by it.

**Outcome:** the device-condition gate that already works in the engine load test becomes the
gate every device measurement passes through, and it covers thermal state and charging as well as
battery. A measurement taken outside its declared conditions comes back non-zero naming the
condition, or — where an override is deliberately allowed — stamps `PROVISIONAL` into the report
itself rather than into a PRD's prose two days later.

**Depends on:** nothing. `adb`, and `scripts/engine-load-test/run-android.ts`, which already does
the hard half.

**Blocks:** [PRD-117](../done/PRD-117-engine-load-test-godot.md) phone arm,
[PRD-074](../native-performance-fixes/PRD-074-scene-collapse-regression-gate.md) Pixel 8 leg, and
[PRD-066](../native-performance-fixes/PRD-066-android-device-frame-rate.md) Phases 2–5.

**Does not block [PRD-118](../done/PRD-118-android-js-engine.md).** See §1 — PRD-118's retake needs a
charged phone and no code at all.

**Complexity: 4 → MEDIUM mode.** One extraction, three call sites, two new conditions. No package
code, no new dependency.

**Blast radius: ~7 repository paths.** `scripts/engine-load-test/run-android.ts`,
`packages/runtime-native/scripts/` (three callers), `packages/runtime-native/tests/`,
`docs/product/PERFORMANCE-BUDGETS.md`, `docs/verification/`.

---

## 1. Why this exists, and what it is *not*

**Start with the correction, because the obvious version of this PRD is wrong.**

PRD-118 holds a 22× result it will not accept:

| Pixel 8, 16 384 cubes, collapsed scene | frame p50 | JS per frame |
|---|---|---|
| QuickJS | 119.19 ms | 115.64 ms |
| **V8** | **8.20 ms** | **5.25 ms** |
| Godot 4.7.1 Android | 39.27 ms | — |

It is easy to read that as *nothing checked the battery*. **Something did.**
`scripts/engine-load-test/run-android.ts:93` `assertDeviceReady` reads `dumpsys battery`, compares
against `MINIMUM_BATTERY_PERCENT`, and throws
`TN_BENCH_LOW_BATTERY: 21% is below the 50% PRD-117 requires`. It fails closed. The run proceeded
because `--allow-low-battery` was passed, which is a documented escape that marks the result
provisional — and the result *is* marked provisional, in two PRDs, correctly.

**So the gate worked, and PRD-118 needs no code from this PRD.** Charge the phone above 50%,
re-run without the flag, update the status line. That is the whole retake, and it is the cheapest
item in this batch.

**What is actually broken is the blast radius of that gate.** It lives inside the engine load test
and is reached by nothing else:

| Lane | Condition check today |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/engine-load-test/run-android.ts` | battery, fails closed, documented override |
| `packages/runtime-native/scripts/measure-android-js-engine.mjs` | **none** — no reference to battery, thermal, charging or `dumpsys` |
| `packages/runtime-native/scripts/measure-cold-start.mjs` | **none** |
| `packages/runtime-native/scripts/verify-android-physics-parity.mjs` | **none** |

One lane fails closed and three fail open, on the same phone, often in the same session. PRD-066's
Phases 2–5 build *a device frame-rate gate that does not exist yet*, and on today's tree it would
be the fourth lane with no condition check.

**And the one gate that exists covers one condition.** Battery is not the only device state that
moves a frame time. A phone already in `THERMAL_STATUS_MODERATE` from the previous run reports the
previous run. A phone on a charger runs hotter than one on battery, and neither the bar nor the
report says which it was.

## 2. What gets checked, and why each one

| Condition | Read via | Why a measurement is invalid without it | New? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Battery level** | `dumpsys battery` | Below ~30% many Android devices cap clocks in a power-saving governor | exists |
| **Charging state** | same | A charging phone runs hotter and throttles differently. Whichever is chosen, the report must say which | **new** |
| **Thermal status** | `dumpsys thermalservice` | A device already throttling measures the previous run | **new** |
| **Screen state** | `dumpsys power` | A screen-off device does not composite | **new** |

Each is **recorded in the report unconditionally**. Each has a bar the calling measurement
declares. Recording without a bar is a note; the bar is what makes it a gate.

## 3. Public shape

The existing function generalised and moved somewhere three more callers can reach it — not
rewritten, and not given a new vocabulary:

```js
const state = await assertDeviceReady(serial, {
  minBatteryPercent: 50,
  requireDischarging: true,
  maxThermalStatus: "NONE",
  allowOverride: false,
});
```

It returns the observed state, which the caller embeds in its report verbatim, or throws with the
failing condition, its bar and its observed value named.

**The override keeps working, and starts costing something.** `--allow-low-battery` today lets a
run proceed and prints `(PROVISIONAL)` to stdout. After this PRD, an overridden run writes
`"provisional": ["battery"]` **into the report JSON**, and any consumer that aggregates or
compares reports refuses to treat a provisional number as an accepted one. Round 9's lesson
applies: a caveat that lives only in prose gets separated from its number.

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Preflight passed; observations are in the report |
| non-zero | A condition failed and no override was permitted. **No number is emitted** |

## 4. Phases

### Phase 0 — Reproduce the three open lanes

Run `measure-android-js-engine.mjs` on the Pixel 8 at whatever charge it holds, and confirm it
emits a full report with no device-condition block. That is the defect observed rather than
inferred from a grep. Half an hour.

### Phase 1 — Extract, generalise, test

Move `assertDeviceReady` somewhere the `runtime-native` scripts can import, add charging, thermal
and screen state, and unit-test the parsers over captured `dumpsys` fixtures — including the
output shapes that vary by Android version. No device needed for the tests.

### Phase 2 — Wire the three unguarded lanes

Each declares its own bar. `measure-cold-start.mjs` keeps its existing emulator refusal; this adds
to it rather than replacing it.

### Phase 3 — Provisional becomes data

`"provisional": [...]` in every device report, and the comparison paths refuse to accept a
provisional number as final.

## 5. Integration ledger

Filled with real non-test `file:line` during implementation. A `TBD` at phase end means the phase
is incomplete.

| # | Thing built | Caller edited so it is reached | What it replaces | When it may claim green | Negative control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Shared `assertDeviceReady` | the three unguarded scripts | a gate reachable from one lane | three callers reach it and their reports carry its block | delete a call → a test fails naming that script |
| 2 | Thermal condition | the shared module | nothing — no thermal check exists anywhere | a throttling device is refused | force a thermal state → refused and named |
| 3 | Charging condition | same | nothing | a charging device fails a discharging bar | measure plugged in → refused and named |
| 4 | Condition block in every device report | the report writers | reports naming the device but not its state | every device report after this date carries one | strip the block → the report is rejected as malformed |
| 5 | `provisional` as a report field | `bench:engines` comparison paths | `(PROVISIONAL)` printed to stdout and lost | an overridden run is refused by the comparison | compare a provisional against a final → refused, exit non-zero |

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All four device lanes reach one shared condition gate, and a test fails if any one of them
      stops reaching it.
- [ ] A measurement below its declared battery bar **exits non-zero, names the condition, the bar
      and the observed value, and writes no report** — observed red with its exit code recorded,
      on each of the three newly wired lanes.
- [ ] The same for thermal status and for charging state, observed red.
- [ ] Every device report written after this PRD lands carries a condition block stating battery
      level, charging state, thermal status and screen state.
- [ ] An overridden run writes `"provisional": [...]` into the report, and a comparison that is
      handed a provisional number **refuses it**, observed red.
- [ ] `PERFORMANCE-BUDGETS.md` states, in one plain clause, that a device number without a
      condition block is not evidence.
- [ ] **PRD-118's retake is executed** on a device ≥50% and discharging, without
      `--allow-low-battery`, and PRD-118's own status line is updated to whatever it shows —
      including if the numbers move. *This criterion needs no code from this PRD and should not
      wait for it.*
- [ ] No file says mobile-ready. One Android device is not mobile.
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm budgets` passes, and no native toolchain
      becomes part of the default gate.

## 7. Negative controls

Every row must be **observed red** with its exit code recorded before the matching pass is
written. A pass with no observed red is recorded `UNVERIFIED`.

| Control | Change | Expected | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `low-battery-unguarded-lane` | run `measure-android-js-engine.mjs` below the bar | non-zero naming battery; no report | not built |
| `charging` | measure while plugged in under a discharging bar | non-zero naming the charging state | not built |
| `thermal-throttling` | measure with thermal status above the bar | non-zero naming the status | not built |
| `no-device` | pass an unattached serial | non-zero before any measurement, never a zero-filled report | not built |
| `emulator-serial` | pass `emulator-5554` | blocked before measurement — the rule PRD-070 already states, preserved | not built |
| `stripped-block` | remove the condition block from a report | report rejected as malformed | not built |
| `unguarded-caller` | remove the gate call from one lane | a test fails naming that lane | not built |
| `provisional-compare` | compare a provisional number against a final one | refused, exit non-zero | not built |
| `unparseable-dumpsys` | feed an unrecognised `dumpsys` shape | non-zero naming the parse failure, **never** a default value | not built |

The last one matters most. A gate that silently defaults an unparseable battery reading to `100`
is worse than no gate, because it launders an unchecked run as a checked one.

## 8. Non-goals

- **Not a benchmark harness.** It gates measurements; it does not take them.
- **Not removing the override.** `--allow-low-battery` exists because a provisional number beats no
  number. It stops being free, not available.
- **Not iOS.** No Apple hardware is attached, and nothing here touches the simulator lane.
- **Not automatic charge management.** It refuses; a human plugs the phone in.
- **Not a re-measurement of past rounds.** Existing provisional numbers stay provisional and
  labelled.

## 9. Kill switches and rollback

- **If PRD-118's charged retake reproduces the 22× within run-to-run variance**, then the 50% bar
  cost the project a fortnight of provisional labelling for no measurable effect. Record that as a
  result *about the bar*, and consider lowering it with the evidence attached. The gate still ships
  — a declared condition that three of four lanes never check is a defect whichever way this
  particular number falls.
- **If the retake moves the numbers materially**, PRD-118's acceptance is re-derived on the new
  ones and the 22× is retracted everywhere it appears.
- **If thermal status proves unreadable on this device's Android build**, ship battery and charging
  and record thermal as unavailable with the command that failed. Do not fabricate a default.
- Rollback is one module and three call sites.
