# PRD-466 — Agent-authored Strata terrain through the Three.js contract

**Status:** PARTIAL
**Priority:** P2 — Remaining five-world art and portable kit/performance qualification.
**Complexity:** 7 (HIGH); risk override: none
**Owner:** ThreeNative maintainers
**Depends on:** None
**Progress:** 8/9 canonical acceptance boxes recorded verified; computed phase label 50% (2/4 phases, 7/13 phase boxes)
**Required companion:** [PRD-467 — live terrain editor](PRD-467-strata-live-terrain-editor.md)
**Required companion:** [PRD-468 — atmosphere, cameras, and asset imports](PRD-468-strata-world-controls-and-asset-imports.md)

## Context

An agent should author useful terrain through code, without Blender or editor
clicks, and use the result through ordinary Three.js objects inside ThreeNative.
Strata already provides the heavy operations: noise, erosion, sculpting, pads,
roads, rivers, material masks, and scatter. The requested integration preserves
those operations and adds replaceable starter art, rendering, and physics wiring.

**Visual goal: Unreal look and feel.** The starter world should read as a realistic,
cinematic landscape: physically scaled PBR surfaces, believable tree/rock shapes,
coherent sun/sky/atmosphere, grounded vegetation, and a realistic coastal ocean.
Procedural shapes are the default; baked Poly Haven textures supply surface detail.
All geometry parameters, textures, lighting, water, and post effects remain editable
game source. The goal names the appearance, not an Unreal runtime dependency.

**Primary output: a self-contained GLB easily usable in any game.** The exported
world includes terrain, trees/rocks/grass, final authored transforms, and embedded
portable PBR textures. ThreeNative powers authoring/preview but is not required
to load the GLB. Export portability is a release criterion, not a later adapter.

The user also requires a terrain editor URL that shows agent changes live, with
individual selection, transform gizmos, GUI polish, and embedded spatial debugging
for map/screenshot reconstruction. That distinct authoring
tool is specified in PRD-467. Both PRDs are required for the complete requested
integration; finishing this runtime/package PRD alone does not finish that goal.

The subsequent execution request authorizes implementation in the shared
PRD-466/467/468 worktree and draft PR #381, with incremental pushes and screenshots of visible milestones attached to
PR #381. npm
publication remains outside this execution request. Complexity is 3 for 11+ implementation files
(mostly recovered supplied modules), 2 for the new authoring module, and 2 for an
independently packed/released optional addon. No marketplace API is required.

### Supplied source and existing integration points

The inputs are `/home/joao/Downloads/AGENT_GUIDE.md` (10,460 bytes, SHA-256
`487453218f870c5e829d58aea3fe9323e74ea93e0aecef8d5c329ecf56972d06`) and
`/home/joao/Downloads/strata-terrain.html` (216,039 bytes, SHA-256
`c0230e6891db829a5196d93ff7c9d714a8f2d964cac4722eb8ce4b2f723d794b`).
The HTML embeds named JS modules, including `src/index.js`, `src/core/*`,
`src/three/adapter.js`, and `src/editor/*`. Recover the supplied modules; do not
rewrite the evaluator or copy the minified HTML into the runtime. The guide names
types but the embedded source inventory does not contain `src/index.d.ts`.
Recover original declarations if available; otherwise type the supported public
surface from the implementation rather than inventing signatures.

Capability search and detail identified existing `Heightfield`, `TerrainTiles`,
`CollisionShape3D`, `rapier`, `compileAssets`, and `WorldCells`. Reuse the terrain,
physics, and asset mechanisms; do not make Strata output masquerade as a `WorldCells` manifest.
Its runtime archive is a different format.

- `packages/core/src/world.ts:94`: `Heightfield` accepts canonical height arrays;
  `toGeometry()` emits Three.js geometry and `toColliderHeights()` transposes to
  Rapier order. `origin` is the field centre, not the southwest corner.
- `packages/physics/src/CollisionShape3D.ts:140`: existing heightfield collider.
- `examples/abyss-framework/src/scenes/TerrainProbe.ts`: existing game-side
  terrain/physics wiring; reference it without replacing that unrelated probe.
- `packages/create-threenative/templates/*/src/render/`: game-owned visual source.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Three.js is currently 0.185.1; the supplied HTML imports
  0.180.0 from a CDN. The integration uses the consumer's installed Three.js.

## Solution

### Package and ownership

Ship an optional **`@threenative/terrain`** addon in `packages/terrain/`, integrated
with the engine's normal package, asset, and capability paths. Ordinary games do
not import it or load its starter assets unless they use terrain generation.
There is one authoring implementation and one optional package, not a separate
terrain renderer, scene graph, or second engine.

The root export contains the supplied headless `Terrain`, `Mask`, evaluation,
baking, and export operations. A `/three` subpath converts baked mesh arrays to
an ordinary indexed `THREE.BufferGeometry`; it never creates a renderer, scene,
camera, light, material, or render loop. `three` is a peer dependency. Keep physics
integration in game source using the existing engine API; the generator does not
depend on Rapier or install a second physics world.

The current [charter](../../architecture/CHARTER.md) excludes recipe systems and
allows a new framework package only for an isolated dependency. Strata authoring
does not automatically satisfy that rule. This plan explicitly proposes a narrow
allowance for the requested optional terrain authoring addon in phase 1. Recipes
remain authoring documents compiled into ordinary runtime data; they never become
an engine scene format. The allowance also covers the five requested editable
terrain starter documents and the terrain-only authoring
companions in PRD-467/PRD-468, including world atmosphere/camera controls and
project asset imports, not a general game editor, genre preset system, or ownership
of appearance. The charter change is part of the integration's review,
not an exception a future implementer may silently infer.

### Consumer flow

```mermaid

  Agent[Agent calls Terrain and Mask] --> Recipe[Serializable authoring recipe]
  Recipe --> Evaluate[Evaluate once during authoring or build]
  Evaluate --> Arrays[Canonical heights, splats, placements]
  Arrays --> Geometry[Ordinary Three.js BufferGeometry]

  Assets[Replaceable local asset mappings] --> Mesh
  Assets --> Cook[Existing asset compiler and loader]

```

Agents use stable operation IDs and `applyPatch()` for revisions. The supported
entry points remain `evaluate()`, `bakeMesh()`, `bakeTerrain()`, and `makeExport()`.
Do not introduce a competing `generate()` API or a CLI vocabulary.

The first game is `examples/strata-terrain-preview/`: a seeded 512-metre map at
257 vertices per side, defaulting to Temperate Forest/Grassland, with an eroded
hill, flat building pad, graded road, procedural trees/rocks/grass, and a river.
A Coastal/Island benchmark supplies the visible realistic ocean. It has a playable character,
not just an orbit screenshot.
The full evaluator runs before play; desktop uses build-baked arrays/assets.
No generation, worker, erosion, or collider rebuild occurs during steady play.
Recover the supplied editor in PRD-467 instead of replacing it with a second
invented editor. The preview owns one ThreeNative renderer and loop. The
terrain generator remains dormant during play; the ocean advances normally.

### Existing capabilities to reuse

These candidates were found with `engine_search_capabilities` and inspected with
`engine_capability_detail`; this is API discovery, not platform execution evidence.

| Area | Installed mechanism/source | Integration and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ocean | `SpectralOcean` from `@threenative/core`; `packages/create-threenative/templates/sailing/src/render/ocean.ts` | Reuse GPU cascaded spectra and adapt the existing lit, displaced water source. Supply every wave parameter; largest cascade first. Surface/material/foam remain the game's. CPU samples are stale readbacks, not exact current contacts. |
| Sky and distance | `Atmosphere`, `AtmosphereLuts`, `directionalTransmittance` from `@threenative/core` | Reuse physical atmosphere nodes/LUT lifetime; game supplies coefficients, sky, sun, and haze appearance. Do not add another atmosphere solver or silently assume Earth constants. |
| Procedural props | `createRandom`, `mergeParts`, `InstancedBatch`, `markStatic` from `@threenative/core` | Seed shape variants; merge static parts per material preserving authored UVs/normals; instance shared variants; freeze only genuinely static subtrees. The game supplies every shape and material. `GroundSnap` is only a rendered-model correction, not collider placement. |
| Baked textures/models | `compileAssets`, `texturePass` from `@threenative/assets`; existing cooked-model LOD | Prepare PBR maps offline, then reuse mipmapped KTX2 cooking and `ctx.assets`. Compressed dimensions must be divisible by four. Cooked GLB LOD applies only when eligible and configured; instancing does not imply automatic LOD. |
| Lighting and measurement | Existing game-owned `worldEnvironment.ts`/post source, Three.js GTAO/SSR, `FrameBudget` | Use current template stages where they improve the actual image. AO radii are metres; SSR is screen-space and does not supply offscreen reflections. Record main/shadow/reflection costs and real GPU measurements; absence is not zero. |

PRD-468 makes atmosphere, sky/sun direction, haze/fog, exposure, environment images
and ocean appearance editable live by both the controller and GUI. Reuse
`Atmosphere.setAtmosphere()` and its validated parameter/LUT mechanisms, plus
the game-owned `WorldEnvironment` source and its `TN_RENDER_CHAIN` diagnostics.
`ctx.assets.resolve()` supplies cooked/local paths for installed Three.js
`HDRLoader`/`EXRLoader`; the ordinary texture loader does not decode HDR skies.
These mechanisms are discovered, not proof that every chosen effect runs on a
target. Appearance and full custom replacement remain game-owned.

The realistic ocean is required. Start from the shipped sailing ocean source,
retain its lit material and displacement-derived normals, then tune wave bands,
shore masking/foam, sun highlights, and horizon coverage for this coastline.
Strata's water output identifies authoring extents/levels; it is not the wave
renderer. The preview's game-owned `src/render/ocean.ts` supplies that mapping.
Shore foam is a visual response to terrain/water depth, not a new fluid simulator.
Validate the chosen spectral path on browser and desktop; unsupported execution
fails visibly. `WaveField` is an explicit analytic alternative only if chosen and
reported; do not silently substitute it and claim the spectral path passed.

`RippleField` and `Buoyancy3D` are available for later interactive splashes/boats,
but neither is needed for this landscape scope. `lightmapPass` requires a static
self-contained GLB with a punctual light, so it is not a blanket terrain-lighting
solution. No blanket enabling of costly post stages to satisfy the visual goal.

`loadTerrainSplat` is another inspected terrain-surface capability: it supplies
world-metre texture tiling, optional triplanar cliffs, macro variation, normals,
and linear splat masks. Its public input requires `terrain.layers.table` and
`terrain.layers.splat` in a world-package document, so it cannot directly consume
Strata's eight-channel array. Reuse the compatible installed surface mechanism
where possible; do not invent a second world format merely to call it. Respect
the documented 16 sampled-texture limit, including mask planes and normal maps;
eight diffuse-plus-normal layers with masks do not fit automatically. The portable
GLB path bakes those blends rather than requiring that shader at load.

### Visual acceptance rubric

Capture the actual seeded coastal scene at fixed seed, time, camera, and 1920×1080:
a close ground/vegetation view, a coast/ocean view, and a landscape overview.
Compare browser and desktop results through the existing playtest capture path.
The implementing agent inspects the rendered captures against this rubric and
records concrete remaining defects on AC-5. A nonblank screenshot alone is not
visual acceptance; subjective Unreal-like quality is not certified by unit tests.

Capture the default Temperate world as well as the Coastal benchmark. Qualify
the remaining starter environments with their defining close/overview views;
do not substitute five labels over the same unchanged material/landform set.

| Area | Required visible result |
| --- | --- |
| Ground | Metre-scaled albedo/normal/roughness detail, coherent grass/dirt/rock/sand transitions, and no stretched cliff UVs or dominant repeated texture grid at the benchmark cameras. |
| Trees and rocks | Varied believable silhouettes, textured bark/leaves/stone, coherent scale and ground contact; simple primitives are construction inputs, not unpolished final cone-tree silhouettes. |
| Coast and ocean | Several visible wave scales, changing normals and sun response, shoreline masking/foam, and a continuous believable horizon without water rectangles cutting across land. |
| Lighting and depth | Consistent sun/sky/exposure, readable contact shadows, atmospheric depth, and restrained post effects without halos, blown glare, or visible shadow instability. |

### Five starter environments, in priority order

| Priority | Editable starter document | Terrain and asset coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Temperate Forest / Grassland | Hills, grass, dirt, rocks, procedural trees, rivers; default reusable baseline. |
| 2 | Mountain / Alpine | Steep slopes, cliffs, valleys, exposed rock and snow; shared rock/tree assets with alpine distribution rules. |
| 3 | Desert / Canyon | Sand, dunes, mesas, ravines and dry rock formations; sparse vegetation rather than a recoloured forest. |
| 4 | Coastal / Island | Beaches, cliffs, coves, ocean edges and replaceable temperate/tropical vegetation; realistic installed ocean. |
| 5 | Snow / Tundra | Snowfields, frozen lake surfaces, rocky outcrops and sparse vegetation; ice is an editable surface, not a fluid simulation. |

Deliver all five as plain editable example recipes plus material/asset mappings
in `packages/terrain/starter/`, selectable by the companion editor. Prioritize
assets and implementation in this order; share textures, geometry variants and
mechanisms. These are authored starting documents, not a hidden runtime genre
system. Changing a biome, swapping all art, or starting blank remains ordinary
recipe/source editing. Default startup uses the first, never a locked showcase.

### Portable full-world GLB export

The supplied `makeExport(..., 'glb')` exports coloured terrain only. Preserve it as
an explicitly terrain-only export and add a full-world export action/API using
the installed Three.js `GLTFExporter`; do not write another GLB encoder. The
proposed public export name/signature must be documented and typed when landed.
Its input is the committed evaluated world plus the game-supplied asset/material
mapping, not an unrelated scene graph reconstructed from placeholder IDs.

Create an export snapshot with terrain, accepted procedural/imported placements,
their final transforms, and ordinary glTF 2.0 PBR materials. Embed every image and
buffer into one `.glb`; no external URLs, JS/TSL, engine plugin, registry lookup,
or unprocessed asset ID is required at load. Preserve metre scale, Y-up, normals,
UVs, winding, alpha cutoff/double-sided foliage choices, and stable object IDs in
optional node extras. Bake terrain splat/triplanar blends into portable UV-mapped
albedo/normal/roughness/AO textures; vertex colours alone do not satisfy the look.

Default export is compatible without engine-specific glTF extensions. Repeated
props can share mesh data through ordinary nodes; do not require
`EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`, ThreeNative LOD metadata, or a custom shader to see them.
Offer such optimizations only as explicit profiles after the portable path passes.
Collision and editable recipes are optional sidecars; neither is required to draw
the GLB, and collision is not invented as a standard GLB guarantee.
Preserve optional local-origin/north/georeference metadata in root extras or an
authoring sidecar, using the PRD-467 coordinate contract. Debug grids, probes,
landmarks, reference overlays and imported reference images stay out of runtime
geometry/materials; a standard game still loads the GLB without GIS tooling.

GLB captures a static world. Bake shader-driven grass deformation and ocean
displacement/normals at an explicit export snapshot time into ordinary geometry
and PBR data. Obtain a coherent resolved ocean snapshot using existing readback
mechanisms; do not label stale running-simulation samples as the requested current
frame. No live FFT/wind/atmosphere/post-processing code is serialized into GLB.
Report any environment-dependent appearance that a receiving game supplies,
and any excluded procedural effect. Unsupported unbaked materials fail by name
rather than exporting a visually empty or terrain-only success.
Preserve editable environment settings and local HDR sources in the project or
optional sidecar; standard GLB cannot carry the running atmosphere, fog, exposure
or post chain. Named authored cameras may be explicitly exported as ordinary
glTF cameras, while default editor/debug cameras stay excluded. PRD-468 qualifies
on-demand imported models/textures through this same portable export path.

The GUI and agent call this same export path. A plain Three.js consumer loads the
file using `GLTFLoader` and renders it without ThreeNative or access to the source
project. Test from an isolated directory with all source/CDN requests disabled;
verify all five starter exports, representative prop counts, selected/manual
transforms, embedded images, and no external glTF resource references. The goal
is a portable asset, not identical lighting in every receiving engine.

### Replaceable starter assets, including Fab

Ship editable, seeded procedural tree, rock, and grass builders as starter render
source, producing ordinary Three.js geometry and materials. Recover useful pieces
of Strata's supplied `defaultAssets()` instead of rewriting them, but improve their
silhouettes/UVs/texturing to meet the rubric. Keep builder parameters in game source;
do not bake a fixed artistic style into the addon evaluator. Generate a bounded
variant set once, then reuse it through existing instancing. Imported models remain
optional replacements, not prerequisites for the default world.

Use baked/prepared Poly Haven PBR maps for surface detail. The ThreeNative asset
MCP's `polyhaven_search_assets`, `polyhaven_get_asset`, and `polyhaven_list_files`
were queried on 2026-09-30. The following shortlist returned explicit **CC0**
metadata; it is license/file-metadata qualification, not downloaded/visually graded
art or an implemented starter pack.

| Role | Qualified candidates | Authors / use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grass and soil | [Leafy Grass](https://polyhaven.com/a/leafy_grass), [Forest Ground 04](https://polyhaven.com/a/forest_ground_04) | Charlotte Baglioni; Rob Tuytel/Rico Cilliers. Baked ground PBR maps. |
| Stone | [Coast Sand Rocks 02](https://polyhaven.com/a/coast_sand_rocks_02), [Rock Moss Set 02](https://polyhaven.com/a/rock_moss_set_02) | Rob Tuytel; Kless Gyzen. Coastal texture plus optional replacement rock meshes. |
| Beach | [Sand 01](https://polyhaven.com/a/sand_01) | Rob Tuytel. Sand PBR maps. |
| Trees | [Bark Brown 02](https://polyhaven.com/a/bark_brown_02), [Jacaranda Tree](https://polyhaven.com/a/jacaranda_tree) | Rob Tuytel; Rico Cilliers/Rob Tuytel. Bark and individually available leaf/alpha maps for procedural foliage; full tree is an optional custom replacement. |

Additional CC0 candidates returned by the same asset MCP are
[Snow 02](https://polyhaven.com/a/snow_02) and
[Snow 01](https://polyhaven.com/a/snow_01) for Alpine/Tundra, and
[Sandstone Cracks](https://polyhaven.com/a/sandstone_cracks) for dry rock/Desert.
All list Rob Tuytel as author. Qualify prepared snow/ice and dry-rock materials
for the relevant starters before claiming all five environments are ready.

File inspection found direct 1K texture downloads, including OpenGL normal maps,
and glTF dependencies. Rock Moss Set 02's 1K glTF plus all listed dependencies totals
1,942,240 bytes. Jacaranda's geometry binary alone is 208,307,808 bytes despite the
1K texture selection: use individual leaf/alpha atlas files for procedural trees,
not that raw mesh as a starter dependency. Measure cooked geometry and bounds before
accepting any optional replacement; catalog dimensions have no confirmed metre
unit here. Do not guess scale or treat a small texture resolution as a small model.

Actual selected file URLs, authors, licenses, content hashes, metre scale, and
preprocessing belong in `packages/terrain/starter-assets/credits.json` during
implementation. Nothing was downloaded or imported by this planning task.

**Fab assets are supported.** Users can load their licensed Fab models/textures
through the same normal asset loader and supply the same mappings. Engine/tool
choice is not the restriction. The distinction is shipping licensed art inside
a game versus redistributing reusable asset source files in an engine package:
[Fab's Standard License summary](https://www.fab.com/eula) permits compatible
tools and incorporated projects but prohibits standalone redistribution.
An asset listed on Fab with a different license or explicit redistribution
permission can be bundled when those terms permit it. No marketplace-wide ban.
[Poly Haven's asset license](https://polyhaven.com/license) is CC0 and explicitly
permits redistribution. Keep provenance even when attribution is not mandatory.
Use local prepared assets at runtime; no credentials, scraping, marketplace
client, or live network dependency is introduced.

The game has editable `src/render/terrain.ts` and `src/world/terrainAssets.ts`:
material construction and texture choices stay in the former; placement asset IDs
map to ordinary loaded `Object3D` models in the latter. The starter sources can be
copied into a game and edited directly. Supplying a custom `THREE.Material` and
custom asset mappings replaces the complete starter look without modifying
package code. Keep Strata's eight material channels as numerical authoring data;
games choose what each channel means visually. Unknown referenced asset IDs fail
with their rule/asset name rather than silently showing placeholder trees.

Prepared textures/imported replacements go through `compileAssets` and `ctx.assets`;
procedural geometry uses the same game-owned materials and `InstancedBatch`.
PRD-468 adds GUI file import and agent registration of local asset MCP outputs:
custom GLB models, PBR images and HDR environments are not limited to these starter
IDs. They are copied/registered under project-owned assets and use the same
compiler/loader, placement mappings and full-world export. Fab import/download
tools already exist in the asset MCP; use their returned local GLBs under the
applicable asset terms instead of adding a second marketplace client.
Never carry over the supplied viewer's renderer. Cap the cooked starter set at 25 MiB, use at most
2K source textures, and expose ordinary file replacement/removal. Every custom
configuration must avoid loading the replaced starter files. This is a bounded
example art set, not a universal art or asset marketplace system.
The 25 MiB cooked budget applies to each selected starter's required content;
do not eagerly load all five environments' textures at startup. Full GLB size is
measured separately, including geometry and baked material atlases.
Choose maps/channels deliberately: albedo is colour data; normals, roughness, AO,
height, and splat weights are linear data. Retain a reproducible packing/baking
step when combining channels or preparing leaf alpha; do not flatten all detail
into diffuse colour or bake one fixed sun into every material.

### Data correctness and failure handling

World units are metres, Y is up, the map is centred on zero, and input heights are
row-major Z then X. Construct `Heightfield` from the final arrays directly with
`rows = columns = resolution`, `width = depth = size`, and centre `{x: 0, z: 0}`.
Do not resample or erode again during collision creation. The baked collision
archive's corner origin must not be passed as a `Heightfield` centre.

Matching samples alone do not prove matching surfaces. The supplied sampler and
`Heightfield.heightAt()` are bilinear, whereas meshes/collision consist of
triangles. Test asymmetric nonplanar cells at interior points on both sides of
the diagonal, edges, and corners. Grounding/placement in the consumer must follow
the actual rendered/collidable triangles; do not claim bilinear queries are exact
triangle contacts. Prefer correcting consumer wiring through existing mesh or
physics queries; if a shared engine defect is demonstrated, fix it in its owning
layer with regression proof rather than patching every game.

Preserve recipe validation, atomic edits/rollback, bounded operations, diagnostics,
and deterministic seeds at the same resolution. Invalid recipes and nonfinite or
wrong-length arrays fail before replacing valid data. No evaluated array edits
pretend to update the recipe. Different export resolutions require fresh inspection;
cross-resolution equivalence is not promised. Splat textures are linear data and
their sampled weights are normalized by game-owned material source. Asset models
are caller-owned; disposing the generated geometry does not dispose shared art.

## Scope limits

The live editor and GUI extension belong to required PRD-467; world controls and
on-demand imports belong to required PRD-468. No new marketplace client, caves,
navigation generation, volumetric fluid simulation,
infinite-world generation, or seamless mixed-LOD claim. The existing spectral
ocean surface is in scope. Defer
`TerrainTiles` integration until a game needs streaming; first prove one finite
terrain using the installed `Heightfield`. Browser WebGPU and Linux native desktop
are required; Android/iOS support is not claimed by these results. Publishing to
npm is separate from locally packing and verifying installable tarballs.

## Acceptance Criteria

The eight phase boxes are required capability criteria AC-1 through AC-7 and AC-9.
AC-8 below proves the portable GLB consumer. Keep evidence on those boxes; do not duplicate
results here. The ninth box adds the explicitly requested ocean behavior rather
than hiding it in a terrain-contact claim. All nine criteria
are `local`, performed by the implementing agent. A Linux native host executable
was present at planning time; this is availability, not runtime proof.

- [x] AC-8 [local, actor: implementing agent]: Each of the five starter worlds exports as a complete self-contained GLB usable by an ordinary game. proof: planned `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:consumer` — Evidence: PASS 2026-10-05 (`24c15427e`). `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:consumer` exit 0: `@threenative/terrain` and `three` tarballs installed outside the workspace; each bake recipe now carries a scatter layer, and every world `bake.mjs` exports is re-authored through public imports, exported as a full-world GLB in a plain browser page and read back by a vanilla `GLTFLoader` with heights equal to the evaluated state, every placement's final transform, embedded 4x4 PBR stand-in maps, zero external URIs and zero external requests. Per world (placements, water, bytes, export+load): alpine 90, none, 3,722,112 B, 1,742 ms; coastal 80, ocean, 3,719,776 B, 1,329 ms; desert 140, none, 3,739,488 B, 1,532 ms; forest 120, lake+river, 3,734,756 B, 1,310 ms; tundra 70, two kettles+two rivers, 3,720,080 B, 1,483 ms. The test now fails a world that places nothing: red control with the previous recipes stops at `alpine: the full-world GLB places nothing`. The same run's game stage scaffolded, built and played an ordinary game from the exported world (105 placements, WebGPU on nvidia/turing, playtest pass). The licensed-art full-world export stays proven by `test:terrain:export` (forest, 202 meshes, 404 PBR maps). Recipe scatter feeds the export only; the game's runtime scatter and baked heights are unchanged.

## Integration Ledger

| Capability | Reachable consumer/trigger | Replaces / disposition | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent terrain authoring | Preview build → public `@threenative/terrain` imports → final baked arrays | Supplied HTML's embedded modules become the maintained source; authoring remains headless | AC-1, AC-8 |
| Three.js interoperability | Consumer → `/three` conversion → game-owned `Mesh` in the existing scene | Do not import `ThreeTerrainView` or its renderer/default scene | AC-2 |
| Playable terrain | Preview scene → existing `Heightfield` and physics context | No separate collision resampling or Strata physics backend | AC-3, AC-4 |
| Starter/custom art | Game render source and asset mapping → compiler → `ctx.assets` | Supplied viewer placeholder assets are replaced; custom mappings bypass starter loads | AC-5, AC-6 |
| Realistic ocean | Game-owned ocean source → installed `SpectralOcean` → lit water mesh | Strata water metadata supplies level/extents; it does not become a wave renderer | AC-9, AC-5 |
| Agent discovery | Capability lookup and shipped addon guide → public imports | No HTML inspection or UI-click requirement | AC-7, AC-8 |
| Portable world export | Committed document → evaluated scene/material bake → GLTFExporter → vanilla GLTFLoader | Supplied terrain-only GLB remains explicitly labelled; new world action includes assets | AC-8; PRD-467 AC-8 |

Paths for the new package/preview are proposed. Record actual non-test entry-point
locations when each phase is implemented; no future line numbers are asserted.

## Decisions

- 2026-09-30 (João, execution steering): Attach rendered screenshots to PR #381 at visible milestones. Newly scaffolded create-threenative projects must ship instructions for the optional terrain editor: installation, controller activation/live URL, shared recipe edits, and baked game/portable GLB handoff. Document executable imports/commands only, and keep ordinary game runtime dependencies optional. Verify the instructions in a fresh scaffold under AC-7 and PRD-467 AC-7.

- 2026-09-30 (implementation): The charter forbids editors/recipe systems and admits packages only for isolated dependencies. The explicitly requested narrow terrain-authoring allowance is now written into the charter; runtime recipes and package-owned appearance remain excluded.

- 2026-09-30 (João): I own the supplied Strata code; use MIT. This explicitly authorizes recovering and distributing the supplied modules under the repository's MIT license; retain source hashes and this ownership grant in the addon provenance notice.

- 2026-09-30 (João): Terrain generation is integrated into ThreeNative and still
  consumed through the Three.js contract; abstractions do the authoring heavy work.
- 2026-09-30 (João): Starter art is wanted and must be fully replaceable with custom
  assets, including assets from Fab.
- 2026-09-30 (planning choice): One optional addon, game-owned appearance, build-time
  generation, and finite terrain first. Narrow charter/package allowance is
  proposed explicitly; no independent terrain editor product is being built.
- 2026-09-30 (planning choice): Fab is supported; bundled redistribution is assessed
  per asset license using the source terms cited above.
- 2026-09-30 (João): Default starter geometry is procedural trees/rocks/etc with
  baked Poly Haven textures; reuse realistic installed ocean mechanisms and aim
  for Unreal look and feel while retaining complete customizability.
- 2026-09-30 (João): A live terrain editor URL and individual object gizmos/GUI
  polish are required. PRD-467 replaces the previous editor-rebuild exclusion.
- 2026-09-30 (João): Deliver the five environment starters in the stated priority
  order, with Temperate Forest/Grassland first; final output is a portable GLB.
- 2026-09-30 (João): Embed spatial inspection/reference alignment and measurable
  terrain-surface feedback in PRD-467 to support reconstruction from maps/screenshots.
- 2026-09-30 (João): Include editable atmosphere/environment, controller camera
  CRUD/focus and arbitrary supported GLB/image imports; required PRD-468 owns
  these additional consumer paths while preserving the standard Three.js contract.
- 2026-09-30 (planning choice): Vegetation search surfaced reusable `mergeParts`,
  `InstancedBatch`, `createRandom`, and static/culling mechanisms, not a dedicated
  installed grass/tree generator. Recover the supplied procedural builders and
  keep appearance source editable. Do not misuse `SoftBody3D` cloth simulation
  as a solver per grass blade. Preserve candidate identity for editor overrides.

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Independent authoring library and Three.js output

**Status:** VERIFIED

**Files:** `packages/terrain/package.json`, `src/index.ts`, recovered `src/core/*`,
`src/three.ts`, public declarations, `AGENT_GUIDE.md`, and
`__tests__/terrain-consumer.spec.ts`; `docs/architecture/CHARTER.md` for the narrow
authoring/package allowance. New paths are proposed; recover rather than redesign.

**Implementation:** Port the supplied public evaluator with its validation and
transactions intact; export one small Three.js geometry adapter. Keep appearance
code, DOM, workers, CDN imports, and the editor out of runtime imports. Add the
addon to the normal build/release configuration without making core depend on it.
Document the generator's source ownership and retain any original license notice;
the supplied HTML alone is not proof of a third-party code license.

- [x] AC-1 [local, actor: implementing agent]: A public-import Node consumer evaluates the seeded recipe with stable-ID replacement and atomic validation failures. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/terrain/__tests__/terrain-consumer.spec.ts` — Evidence: public-consumer suite passes 7 tests; deterministic arrays, stable-ID replacement, failed-patch rollback and headless imports verified. A SHA-256 regression preserves supplied noise/hydraulic/thermal output. The initial integration baseline directly compared supplied Alpine/Coastal/Desert at resolution 33, matching every layer height/splat buffer and final placements/biomes. PRD-467 subsequently fixes the supplied scatter identity/RNG defect: placement keys and distributions intentionally change; the supplied noise/erosion SHA-256 regression still passes.
- [x] AC-2 [local, actor: implementing agent]: Generated terrain is ordinary indexed geometry compatible with the consumer's Three.js identity. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/terrain/__tests__/terrain-consumer.spec.ts` — Evidence: the same 7 tests pass with the consumer's `BufferGeometry`, custom magenta material and downward raycaster; upward winding, finite indexed attributes, collision arrays and caller disposal verified. Empty/nonfinite/wrongly typed GLB input fails; explicit palettes are optional and no material is selected by the addon.

### Phase 2: ThreeNative rendering and matching collision

**Status:** VERIFIED

**Files:** `examples/strata-terrain-preview/package.json`, existing-template-derived
build config, `src/game.ts`, `src/world/terrain.ts`, `src/render/terrain.ts`,
`src/render/ocean.ts`, and
`playtests/terrain.playtest.json`. Extend relevant existing engine tests only if
the asymmetric fixture demonstrates a shared engine defect.

**Implementation:** Bake the representative recipe before game startup; render its
mesh in the normal game scene and register collision through the owning physics
context. Match coordinates and triangle surfaces. Exercise an asymmetric height
fixture as well as the hill/road, with a grounded moving character. Reuse the
existing asset/build/playtest paths for both targets. Expose measured contact error
and travel distance through the existing playtest bridge; never hardcode success.
Adapt the existing sailing ocean source; use game-owned atmosphere/lighting and
material source. Ocean compute advances every frame without reevaluating terrain.

- [x] AC-3 [local, actor: implementing agent]: Browser WebGPU play exercises the generated hill/road with matching rendered and physical ground. proof: `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:web` — Evidence: PASS 2026-09-30 — existing runner with `--browser-recipe webgpu --headed`, NVIDIA/turing RTX 2080, 903 scenario ticks; the resource wait observes at least 50 m of walking (62.94 m in the isolated walk), grounded character, 371 coastal contact samples and maximum error 0.000043 m (isolated walk 609 samples, 0.000057 m). The 17×17 asymmetric fixture includes both cell interiors/diagonal sides and exact edge/corner probes, with measured bilinear-vs-triangle difference 1.5 m. No console, runtime or asset errors; inspected nonblank screenshots are attached on the PR. Walking probes compare identical oblique rays through the rendered and physical surfaces; this is not a claim that Rapier’s near-boundary vertical ray miss is fixed.
- [x] AC-4 [local, actor: implementing agent]: The same baked terrain scenario runs in the Linux native desktop host. proof: `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:desktop` — Evidence: PASS 2026-09-30 — existing native bundler plus `--target desktop --executable ../../packages/runtime-native/build/tn-linux/mystral` and `run dist/strata-terrain-native.js`; 903 scenario ticks, observed 50 m travel wait, grounded character, 371 final ground samples and maximum mesh/physics error 0.000043 m. NVIDIA RTX 2080 host, inspected nonblank terrain/coastal captures, no runtime/console errors. A separate host run completes 300 render frames in 7,655 ms and captures nonblank terrain (226 presentations; not a steady-state FPS result). Ocean compute/readback and actual displaced/lit water captures pass; mobile results are not claimed.
- [x] AC-9 [local, actor: implementing agent]: The coastal ocean mesh visibly consumes the installed spectral simulation in the game scene. proof: AC-3 and AC-4 scenario runs — Evidence: PASS 2026-10-01 — both target scripts pass the shared scenario and the installed PNG inspection check. Camera-matched early/later water captures change 71.2% of qualified water pixels; after moving the actual directional light, 54.2% change. Directly inspected browser/native captures show displaced wave shading, depth-colour transition and foam/masking from the baked coast. The lit standard node material consumes both spectral cascade buffers and central-difference normals. CPU sample slopes are reported separately as stale readback, not a numerical rendered-normal measurement. Both targets observe compute/readback activity; no runtime/asset errors. Final starter art/atmosphere quality remains AC-5.

Phase 2 verified: the preview bakes seeded 512 m / 257-vertex forest and
coastal worlds before startup and consumes only baked arrays in its game graph.
Headed browser capture names NVIDIA/turing; headless Chromium selected SwiftShader
and lost its WebGPU instance. Browser/native artifacts have separate directories.
The first native ocean failure was game clock wiring: deterministic ticks do not
run beforeRender. Ocean.advance now runs in Scene.update before compute dispatch.
The scenario observes 361 spectral steps and 360 samples. Two recorded ocean times
and an actual sunlight change qualify visible displaced/normal-lit water on both
targets; the game-owned shader samples canonical baked heights for depth colour,
shore foam and opacity. CPU slope variation remains a stale readback proxy.
The separate native host run renders 300 frames and captures the terrain; its
226 presentations and wall time are not a steady-state frame-rate claim.

Raw Rapier reproduces a vertical-ray miss at z=159.99998474121094 near a
heightfield grid boundary. Walking probes compare identical oblique rays in mesh
and physics; asymmetric fixtures retain exact vertical edge/corner checks. This
does not claim the dependency's near-boundary vertical miss is fixed.

### Phase 3: Replaceable starter assets and cold-agent workflow

**Status:** PARTIAL

**Files:** `packages/terrain/starter-assets/`, editable starter source under
`packages/terrain/starter/`, preview `src/world/terrainAssets.ts` and
`src/render/terrain.ts`, `packages/terrain/__tests__/starter-assets.spec.ts`,
`packages/create-threenative/capabilities.json` through its generator, and addon
agent documentation. Update the relevant template guidance and regenerate its
`CLAUDE.md` mirror only when the guidance changes.

**Implementation:** Prepare the bounded texture set and source/license metadata;
copy editable procedural builders, material, ocean, lighting, and mapping source
into the preview. Reuse seeded randomness, geometry merging, cooking, loading,
and instancing. Extend `test:terrain:web` / `test:terrain:desktop` with the fixed
visual benchmark cameras and inspect their actual captures against the rubric.
Use `FrameBudget` to record main/shadow/reflection cost at the representative prop
count; choose existing AO/SSR stages by measured benefit, not a blanket preset.
Add all five editable starter documents/mappings and the portable full-world
GLTFExporter path, including material/deformation baking and ordinary node
instances. Keep full-world export semantics distinct from the supplied legacy
terrain-only GLB. Extend the packed/vanilla consumer for all five files.
Custom assets, including licensed Fab assets, are supplied
as normal local models/textures; no special import format or vendor account is
needed. The automated replacement test uses attributable custom test art, not
private paid files. Make public terrain authoring discoverable in the installed
capability workflow without claiming optional imports exist before installation.

**Vegetation lane (owner: "trees are not ok, leaves look like crap; why insist on procedural
trees?").** The Temperate forest now draws the owner's licensed **Landscape Pro 2.0** pack
(Fab listing `1ac647da-b1bc-4e72-a56d-60aaeb6918e1`) instead of procedural trees:
`scripts/prep-landscape-pro.mjs` copies nine species plus three's Basis transcoder from the owner's
Fab import into the gitignored `local-assets/landscape-pro/` (1.4 MB of meshopt-compressed meshes,
11.4 MB with the pack's shared UASTC images; `--raw` reads the uncooked import instead), and
`src/render/pack.ts` loads them as ordinary prop variants — no new package, no new mechanism.
Measured by `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:web` on the RTX 2080 at 1920x1080:
prop draws 20 -> **24** (the scenario's ceiling, unchanged — the CC0 rocks' second LOD level paid for
the canopy's), prop triangles 1.92 M -> **2.20 M**, prop instances 6,672 -> 7,361, and the two judged
framings' p50 frame cost measured **3.9-7.4 ms at the meadow and 3.2-5.7 ms at the overview across
four runs** — a spread wider than the change, on a host whose load average was 15-26 from other
agents' browser benchmarks, and the engine's own scene warning names `objectsConsidered` rather than
triangles as the dominant term. Wildwood's per-section gains (`[3.9, 3.4, 2.7]` bark,
`[3.3, 3.6, 2.8]` leaf) render paper-white under this sky's 3.2-intensity sun and AgX curve and were
cut to about a third with a mip-compensated cutoff, which is what the captures show. The draw ceiling
was **not** raised. With the folder absent the world grows the procedural spruce, boulder, fern, grass
and poppy as before; that fallback run is recorded with this note. AC-5 stays open: one environment's
vegetation is not five.

- [ ] AC-5 [local, actor: implementing agent]: The five editable starter environments satisfy their defining terrain/art coverage and Unreal-like visual rubric. proof: planned `pnpm exec vitest run packages/terrain/__tests__/starter-assets.spec.ts` plus AC-3/AC-4 benchmark captures — Evidence: partial (terrain half; see the relief pass above). Terrain relief, drainage, talus and mesa benches are measured. All four non-temperate defining browser views now render, with world/material/frame/camera observations for Alpine, Desert and Tundra; see the 2026-10-02 execution above. Still pending: final art and atmosphere meeting the Unreal/Gaia rubric, the tundra ice lake, and the 25 MiB cooked budget per starter with no runtime fetches. Asset tests or nonblank captures alone cannot tick this visual criterion.
- [x] AC-6 [local, actor: implementing agent]: A consumer completely replaces starter materials and placement models without generator edits. proof: `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:custom` — Evidence: PASS 2026-10-02 — one script runs the shared `playtests/terrain.playtest.json` twice over the same generator, the same render modules and the same baked arrays, differing only in `src/world/terrainAssets.ts`: the committed bytes, then a consumer's table naming five 8×8 procedural PNGs and one hand-written 12-triangle GLB the script writes into a temporary directory. Every scenario assertion, `diagnostics` included, passes in both arms (0 console errors each). The replacement reached the renderer — the 12-triangle fixture is among the drawn props and no stock node has that triangle count; the custom arm resolved 5 files, all 5 from its own `/__custom-art/` root and 0 of the 27 starter files the stock arm resolved, so the two arms are distinguishable. The generator is untouched: `world`, `contactSamples`, `maxContactError` (3.12e-05 m), `bilinearDifference` (1.5 m) and `sampleSlopeRange` are identical across arms. `propInstances` is deliberately recorded rather than compared (2130 stock, 1990 custom): the placement set is the generator's and identical, but the consumer's own variants replace the starter's four prepared files, so a different instance count is the correct answer. A third arm whose needle atlas names a file nobody wrote makes the same checker both arms went through throw, and the throw names `absent-needle-atlas.png`. The committed table is restored and byte-compared in the run's `finally`, so no arm can leave the repository pointing at temporary fixtures. The first custom run failed `diagnostics` on 26 console errors, both fixture faults and both now fixed in the fixture: the marker GLB had no UVs, and the consumer table gave all six ground layers a normal map, which is 18 samplers against WebGPU's 16 per stage (the starter spends the 16 with normals on four layers) — a truthful constraint on custom ground art, recorded in the script.
- [x] AC-7 [local, actor: implementing agent]: Installed capability lookup leads an agent to the actual public terrain authoring API. proof: `pnpm build` plus `pnpm capabilities:check` and packed-consumer capability lookup in `test:consumer` — Evidence: PASS 2026-10-02 — `pnpm build` exit 0 (53 s), `pnpm capabilities:check` fresh (400 entries, 393 of 393 package-backed entries resolvable), `pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-mcp/__tests__/terrain-discovery.spec.ts` green, and `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:consumer` green (~12 s) from tarballs installed outside the workspace. Through the packed `threenative-engine-mcp` and the packed manifest, four queries resolve at rank 0 to the public import: a request-scope island prompt and "procedural heightmap landscape" to `Terrain` in `@threenative/terrain`, "export the terrain as a glb for another three.js project" to `exportWorldGLB` in `@threenative/terrain/export`, "open the terrain brush and layer GUI" to `mountTerrainEditor` in `@threenative/terrain/editor`. `Terrain`'s constraints now state metres with Y up and the 1 to 100000 size, the seven allowed resolutions (17 to 1025), the 0 to 4294967295 seed and that one document and seed give the same arrays (the consumer re-evaluates all five worlds and matches the game's baked heights hash-for-hash), the synchronous `evaluate()`, and that materials, models and texture paths belong to the game; a negative control that asserts a wrong unit fails by name. All eleven packed templates and a fresh `createProject` scaffold carry the terrain pointer in both AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md, list no authoring dependency, and `terrain-authoring.md` names the install, the editor server entry, `exportWorldGLB` and the shipped `AGENT_GUIDE.md`; the packed editor entry exports `mountTerrainEditor` and `TerrainEditorController`. Not covered: the `capability-examples` spec fails on `@threenative/metahuman`, `raw-unreal`, `ueformat` and `ui` modules that are not built in this checkout (no terrain entry in its list). Fresh create-threenative output includes the optional terrain/editor install and workflow instructions, linked to the shipped addon guide; verify the generated AGENTS/CLAUDE mirrors and packed editor entry without adding authoring dependencies to ordinary game runtime.

#### Temperate forest replacement (2026-10-02), Evidence: partial visual increment

The game cooks the owner's Project Nature spruce/grass/ground/flower/fern art and Epic
Kite photoscanned boulders, river rock, scree and cliff into gitignored
`local-assets/temperate/` via `scripts/prep-fab-temperate.mjs`. Source atlas bindings,
opacity channels and aligned GLB views are repaired before the installed meshopt/UASTC
cook; duplicate sections are joined. The chosen 27 source models comprise three full,
two half and three small spruces, four grasses, four flowers (including red), three ground
clumps, two ferns, five rocks and one cliff. Five reduced adult-tree distance models are
included. The output is **111,163,436 bytes (111.16 MB)**, below the 120 MB limit.
Licensed bytes remain local; no licensed asset is tracked.

The former 140-tree ceiling becomes **3,200 noise-masked spruce placements** at a
3.4 m minimum spacing, with clearings, **4,144 saplings** at stand edges and **6,320
ferns**. Grass follows the rendered meadow slope/elevation mask instead of the obsolete
baked colour palette. Coarse cover spans meadows; 28 cm sampling fills nearby meadow
and river eyes. **139,460 grass placements** combine photographed stalks with low,
olive generated basal blades; **41,785 ground clumps** fill intervening ground.
**1,317 photographed flowers** replace cartoon poppies when the pack is present.
Stone placements are **795 boulders, 54 river rocks, 55 scree and 3 cliffs**.
Total placements: **197,133**.

Appearance remains game-owned: whole-model scaling aligns tree sections, soft canopy
volume normals brighten crowns, leaf-only grading preserves bark, photographed stones
retain diffuse/normal maps, and alpha-to-coverage on the observed 4x-MSAA WebGPU renderer
uses a distance-graded cutoff without dither. Existing `InstancedBatch` groups species,
variants and distance levels. Adult spruces use two mesh levels, with reduced adult shapes
at 60 m; this increment does not add impostors. Small cover and rocks have distance culling;
small cover casts no shadows. Canonical poses and compact slot IDs preserve editor changes
through refills. Moving a culled prop into view invalidates assignments even with a stationary
camera, and refills refresh bounds. The runnable scatter/edit check reproduces these cases.

Final current-code WebGPU repeats, `artifacts/playtest/final-1/` and `final-2/`:

| Run | Meadow frame p50 | Overview frame p50 | Allocated prop batches | Meadow / overview submitted triangles |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| final-1 | 2.2 ms | 1.4 ms | 58 | 59,308,158 / 14,170,902 |
| final-2 | 2.3 ms | 1.5 ms | 58 | 59,308,158 / 14,170,902 |

These are logged frame-cost measurements and submitted triangles across passes, not GPU FPS.
`propDraws` counts allocated batches; the ceiling rises from 24 to **60** for the requested
species, tree levels and basal cover, supported by both measured runs below 8 ms.
Both runs pass every behavioural assertion and fail only the pre-existing destroyed
`ShadowDepthTexture used in a submit` console diagnostic (378/382 console errors;
zero network errors or runtime diagnostic entries). Coastal captures are excluded as instructed.
The entire `local-assets` folder was moved away once: `artifacts/playtest/fallback/`
visibly renders procedural trees, cover and flowers; every behavioural assertion passes,
with **40 batches and 1.6/1.6 ms**, only the same shadow diagnostic. The folder is restored.

Example typecheck, repository lint (pre-existing warnings), the runnable
`node --import tsx examples/strata-terrain-preview/scripts/check-temperate.mts`,
document links and agent mirror checks pass. Native and the full implementation suite were
not run. Three checkpoint commits preceded the final evidence commit; one checkpoint gap
was 32 minutes rather than the requested maximum 30 minutes.

Fresh visual review of final captures: grass continuity, photographed rocks and forest density
are substantially improved. Grass still reads pale/card-like, crowns remain noisy and drooping,
and the meadow lacks the reference's rich olive shading and strong red flower drifts.
**AC-5 remains open**: this is a working Temperate increment, below the Gaia/Unreal target.

#### Terrain relief pass (2026-10-02), Evidence: measured, plus four engine bugs

Owner feedback on the round-4 captures: *"everything too plane and thin. No erosion, cliffs, etc.
Looks unrealistic and synthetic."* Three of the four causes were engine defects, not recipe taste.

**Engine.** `hydraulic()` defaulted to a flat 5000 droplets at any resolution, so a 257-vertex world
got one droplet per 13 cells. The default is now grid-scaled (`n²` droplets, `maxSteps` that can cross
the world). Raising the count alone was not the fix: with the old 0.25 per-step bite, one droplet per
cell carved **746** single-cell dimples standing a metre proud of their neighbours, and incision
*fell* past ~0.5 n² because every extra droplet re-dug the same lines. A shallow 0.03 bite over the
same budget incises the same drainage (0.8 % of cells) with 14 spikes. Both are red-green in
`packages/terrain/__tests__/erosion-defaults.spec.ts`, including the spike assertion, which fails
against the 0.25 bite.

Two further engine bugs surfaced while measuring, both silent:
- `brushWeights` fell back to `mask ?? new Float32Array(len)` for a layer with no `at`/`points`.
  A fresh `Float32Array` is all **zeros**, so a brushless layer covered *nothing*: `smooth` was a
  no-op and `sculpt` added nothing. Now filled with ones
  (`terrain-consumer.spec.ts`: "applies a brush operation over the whole world when no brush is given").
- The bake cache's skip called `process.exit(0)`, which killed `measure-spikes.mjs` — it reported
  zero spikes without ever counting any. The skip is now entry-point only.

**Recipes** (`scripts/bake.mjs`, all five worlds). Billow folds for the shoulders and troughs the
carve then drains; one settle pass, not two; a thermal talus per world (40° scree on the alpine,
38° coastal cliff, 36° forest); terrace on the mesa walls; every hardcoded 1200-5000 droplet count
dropped for the grid default. The forest stream is re-traced — the old points ran off the east edge
under the new landform — and the lake reseeded onto the basin it actually ends in.

Measured by `scripts/measure-terrain.mjs` (D8 flow accumulation, prominence > 1 m as a spike):

| world | relief | % >30° | % >45° | channels % | spikes | bake ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| forest | 76 → **91 m** | 3.8 → **22.4** | 0.7 → **3.0** | 7.4 → 4.9 | 1 → **3** | 2595 |
| coastal | 118 → **124 m** | 9.5 → **30.9** | 1.7 → **6.3** | 10.9 → 6.6 | 1 → **5** | 1554 |
| alpine | 150 → **181 m** | 21.3 → **35.6** | 11.8 → **15.7** | 7.4 → 6.6 | 104 → **28** | 1903 |
| desert | 74 → **70 m** | 11.3 → 11.3 | 8.5 → **6.5** | 5.9 → 4.4 | 93 → **10** | 1604 |
| tundra | 14 → **46 m** | 0.6 → **22.4** | 0.0 → 1.2 | 5.3 → 4.7 | 10 → **0** | 1787 |

Alpine and desert spikes fell from 104/93 to 28/10; the mesa stamp's own fbm skin at `roughness:
0.25` was standing a metre proud over a tenth of the desert, now 0.06. Bake is authoring-time only and
`pnpm dev` now skips an unchanged bake (19 s → 0.07 s), which the 15 s dev-server readiness budget
required. Gates: `pnpm --filter @threenative/terrain build` clean, `vitest run packages/terrain` 59/59,
`--filter strata-terrain-preview typecheck` clean, `pnpm lint` shows no diagnostic in any file this
change touches (its 10 errors are pre-existing on `develop`). Captures inspected directly:
`overview.png` shows dendritic drainage with rock in the channels, `forest-walk.png` a cut bank and a
worn dirt scatter, `river.png` the lake sitting in the basin the traced stream feeds. **AC-5 stays
open** — this fixes terrain only; the five environments' art, atmosphere and the coastal/alpine/
desert/tundra *defining views* are not yet captured and judged.

### AC-5 ground round 2 — 2026-10-02 (continuation)

First increment preserves the retained rock height blend and mountain layering, then reduces
the grass warp (the stronger warp drew swirls), blends rotated texture scales with the same
mask in colour and normals, retains distant stone detail, and refines the horizon mesh.
Rock is brown-grey and restricted to scarps; distant scenery has forest, rock and high snow
bands. Directly inspected captures: `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round2-material/`
(`meadow-close.png`, `overview.png`, `forest-walk.png`, `river.png`). Full-frame display-space
Y p05/p50/p95: meadow **0.236/0.431/0.738**, overview **0.217/0.402/0.484**,
walk **0.078/0.385/0.495**, river **0.012/0.415/0.815**; these are image statistics, not
linear-light luminance or a visual-quality score. Existing WebGPU scenario, NVIDIA/Turing,
passes every resource assertion (595 contact samples, max error **0.000004 m**); only
`diagnostics` fails, with the known destroyed `ShadowDepthTexture` errors after the coastal
switch. Meadow/overview engine frame p50: **3.9/3.3 ms**, excluding presented-frame gaps.
Example typecheck and root lint pass (lint warnings remain); terrain tests **60/60** pass.
An interrupted capture was invalidated by a measurement rebaking JSON during Vite play;
the recorded retry ran with no file writes. Decisions: reuse existing maps and daylight,
keep appearance in game source, leave the collider and other lanes untouched. Gullies,
water and contact AO remain the next increments; the mountains still need stronger relief.
**AC-5 remains open; this is an improvement, not an Unreal-level verdict.**

Second increment: forest hydraulic inertia/load/bite are reduced, with a 34° talus and
16 settling iterations. `node scripts/measure-spikes.mjs`: **1 spike, worst 1.7 m** (was 3).
The stream's existing curved route still ends in the same basin: measured rendered stream
end **10.55 m**, lake bed **10.26 m**, level **12.4 m**; its 4,540 m² connected flooded
component reaches no world edge. No engine package changed. A game bug was reproduced:
the bake stores lake centres as `[x,z]`, while the renderer read `[x,y,z]`, drawing at
z=0 or returning no lake. Both consumers now read the actual centre; shore tracing stays
inside the resident heightfield and stops at the first bank. The existing playtest now
fails on missing/misplaced lake geometry (`lakePlacementError`, observed **0 m**).
Wet banks share the curvature texture's second channel, with lower roughness and darker
soil. The stream uses the lake's existing radiance composite without a second PBR glint;
foam and shallow-edge opacity are reduced. Inspected `artifacts/playtest/round2-water/`
captures now show a reflective lake in its basin; **the small upstream white strip remains**,
so this does not claim the stream defect finished. Meadow/overview frame p50 **3.2/4.0 ms**;
full-frame display Y p05/p50/p95: meadow **0.225/0.434/0.738**, overview
**0.209/0.402/0.483**, walk **0.070/0.386/0.493**, river **0.181/0.411/0.822**.
All resource assertions pass; only known coastal shadow-texture `diagnostics` fails.
Example typecheck, root lint (warnings only) and terrain tests **60/60** pass.


Third increment: the walked-view dark trench was traced by the actual chase-camera ray to
`[-141,153]`, on the building pad's cut, rather than the hydraulic drainage. Widening that
pad's existing falloff from 0.35 to 0.75 reduces its sampled wall maximum from **53.44° to
42.80°**; the inspected walk now shows a graded bank. Spike check remains **1 / 1.7 m**.
The distant ground normal no longer carries subpixel grass grain; the horizon has denser
radial sampling, stronger ridges, a lower high-snow band and slightly thicker aerial haze.
Installed GTAO plus denoise runs at half resolution with eight samples through the existing
`ambientOcclusion` RenderChain stage, automatically dropping below medium tier. It uses the
template's normal MRT: the first depth-derived-normal attempt failed on multisampled depth
and was discarded. Both stage-presence and actual graph-contribution assertions now pass.
The per-view geometry floor now measures peak submitted triangles within each pass window:
AO nests the world pass alongside single-triangle full-screen passes, whose median alone
incorrectly reported two triangles. Full scenario passes all resources and AO assertions;
only **391 shadow-texture diagnostics errors** fail (three occur at startup; the coastal switch dominates the rest). WebGPU only; no native
claim. Engine frame p50 meadow/overview **1.8/2.2 ms**, excluding presentation gaps. Previous
complete-window GPU medians with/without AO were **9.65/9.28 ms**, not an isolated AO benchmark.
Inspected `artifacts/playtest/round2-ao/`: display Y p05/p50/p95 meadow
**0.239/0.446/0.737**, overview **0.254/0.414/0.491**, walk **0.142/0.391/0.500**,
river **0.204/0.413/0.821**. Example typecheck, root lint (warnings only), terrain tests
**60/60** pass. Stream glints now fade with footprint, but its distant white reach remains
unfinished; mountain faces remain more procedural than the reference. AC-5 stays open.


Fourth increment: a refraction ablation leaves the white upstream strip unchanged,
locating its source in low-angle sky reflection. The stream now blends the average wooded
bank into sky over a broad angle, retaining green bank radiance instead of the earlier black
facets. The sampled stream patch's display Y median falls **0.580 → 0.321**; the inspected
reach is green-blue, with the existing shallow-depth edge and wet terrain margin. Refraction
was restored; no debug colour or constant-bed substitution remains. Rounded ridge cusps
remove regular silhouette teeth, secondary ridges vary the outline, and the existing rock
normal map is reused at **30.4 m** scale on distant rock faces. High snow, rock faces and
forest-dark lower slopes remain separate from the resident ground. A trial raising the hill
stamp roughness to 0.25 added a spike without a clear drainage improvement; it was rejected.
Final recipe remains **1 spike / 1.7 m**, with the same basin and curved stream route. Basin
measurement after the retained pad edit: **4,540 m²**, no world-edge flood, bed **10.26 m**,
level **12.4 m**, rendered stream end **10.55 m**. The pad edit is far from this basin.

Delivery WebGPU scenario: **23/24 assertions pass**; only diagnostics fails (**390** counted
console errors, all destroyed `ShadowDepthTexture`; console artifact contains 391 entries).
Stage presence and graph contribution pass. AO introduces three startup errors of this
same class before the larger known coastal failure; this renderer issue is unresolved.
Contacts: **595**, maximum measured error **0.000004 m**, lake placement error **0 m**.
Meadow/overview engine frame p50: **1.2/1.6 ms**, excluding presentation gaps; forest-only
GPU median across **49 window p50s: 22.81 ms**. Presented-window median is **100 ms** in
this stepped capture run: neither the CPU metric nor the GPU statistic claims player FPS.
Example typecheck, root lint (1,054 warnings, no errors), terrain tests **60/60**, and diff
whitespace check pass on this delivery source. No push and no native verification.

Final captures and runner provenance: `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round2-final/`
(`meadow-close.png`, `overview.png`, `forest-walk.png`, `river.png`, `capture.json`, `console.json`).
Full-frame linear-light luminance p05/p50/p95, decoded from captured sRGB:
meadow **0.048/0.168/0.494**, overview **0.054/0.147/0.210**,
walk **0.017/0.128/0.209**, river **0.030/0.135/0.617**.
Display-space Y for comparison with earlier increments: meadow **0.239/0.444/0.729**,
overview **0.254/0.416/0.494**, walk **0.138/0.389/0.492**, river **0.188/0.399/0.806**.

Verdict per defect: rock/grass tiling materially improved; the walked-view pad trench is
softened, but some radial drainage fans remain; distant layering and detail are improved,
but mountain form still reads more procedural than Gaia; the white stream reach is repaired
and the lake now occupies its actual basin; installed AO is visibly active within the observed
median GPU budget, with the startup shadow issue disclosed above. **Below the Unreal-level
target: AC-5 remains open.** Decisions: use installed maps/RenderChain, reuse the existing
wet/curvature binding, repair the game lake coordinate bug in both consumers, reject the
extra-spike recipe, and leave engine packages and other lanes untouched.


Fifth/final increment: the remaining drainage fans receive a bounded increase in the existing
valley domain warp, **25 → 40 m**. A 55 m trial curved the drainage but let the connected
flood component reach the world edge, so it was rejected. The retained 40 m overview has
more curved drainage; the pad's graded bank remains intact. Actual final spike check:
**2 spikes, worst 1.5 m** (the incoming control had 3; the previous increment had 1 / 1.7 m).
Tradeoff accepted for more curved form and a lower worst excursion. The basin remains at
the same authored centre and level: **1.20 m** depth, **4,796 m²** connected flood, **no
world edge**. Rechecked existing stream route against this field: end surface **11.49 m**
enters the **12.4 m** lake, **zero uphill steps**, minimum interior station depth **0.88 m**.
The connected basin did not move, so the existing curved control points are retained.

This capture supersedes the fourth increment's final statistics and files above. All
resource and AO assertions pass (**23/24** total); diagnostics alone fails with **392**
counted destroyed-shadow-texture errors (393 console-artifact entries of that same class).
The disclosed three startup errors remain. Contacts **595**, max error **0.000004 m**,
lake placement error **0 m**. Meadow/overview engine frame p50 **1.4/2.2 ms**; forest-only
GPU median across **49 window p50s: 19.09 ms**. Presented-window median **100 ms** during
stepped capture; no player-FPS claim. Example typecheck, root lint (warnings only), terrain
**60/60**, and diff whitespace check pass. The final recipe and results are committed; captures remain local, with generated
JSON/local licensed art kept out of the index.

`artifacts/playtest/round2-final/` now holds the retained 40 m captures and runner provenance;
`round2-before-warp/` preserves the previous pictures. Final full-frame linear-light
luminance p05/p50/p95: meadow **0.054/0.168/0.494**, overview **0.055/0.147/0.209**,
walk **0.019/0.130/0.219**, river **0.026/0.118/0.617**. Display Y:
meadow **0.256/0.444/0.729**, overview **0.258/0.417/0.492**,
walk **0.146/0.392/0.503**, river **0.173/0.376/0.806**.
Final verdict remains **improved, below the Unreal/Gaia target**: broad fan forms and soft
mountain silhouettes still need work. AC-5 stays open. No push; native unverified.

### AC-5 Alpine / Desert / Tundra execution (2026-10-02)

The shared preview now renders all five worlds. Keys 1–5 and `?world=` select the scene;
Alpine/Desert/Tundra JSON is lazy-loaded. Ground palette, sun, sky, haze and horizon landform
live in `src/render/biomes.ts`; terrain hooks remain optional and preserve forest/coast defaults.

- Alpine: broader summit snowfield and side ridge, relaxed scree aprons, snow normal relief,
  lower spruce treeline and Kite boulders/scree. Freestanding cliff blocks are excluded.
- Desert: sand/sandstone palette, dry gravel, mesa continuation, smoother foreground and a
  closer defining camera. All boulder slots use the two shipped CC0 scans where available.
- Tundra: broad low plain (median slope 4.3°, previously 17.5°), cold sky, lichen/gravel,
  broken snow and stunted saplings. Its frozen-lake surface remains pending.
- Scene transitions previously carried the outgoing camera name. Entry now resets to player;
  the scenario asserts the three entries, defining views and overviews, plus world/material
  identity, fresh render-frame counts and five-metre walks. Original coastal captures precede
  the new visits, preserving their wave/foam timing; the final return retains coastal gates.

Final normal-asset browser run passes **35/35**, exit 0 (`/tmp/worlds-final3.log`).
NVIDIA Turing WebGPU, 1920×1080; console/network/runtime errors **0/0/0**. Engine frame-window
p50: meadow **2.2 ms**, overview **2.0 ms**, alpine ridge **2.2 ms**, desert mesa **1.0 ms**,
tundra plain **1.2 ms**. These are engine frame measurements, not presented-FPS claims.
`verify-ocean.mjs` passes wave change, sun change and sheltered-water checks (blue ratio 1.0).
Example typecheck, root Biome error checks and diff whitespace checks pass.
Captures: `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/web/{alpine-ridge,alpine-overview,
desert-mesa,desert-overview,tundra-plain,tundra-overview}.png`, inspected at native resolution.

Decisions: use existing cooked spruces/saplings and Kite stone, with procedural/CC0 fallbacks;
no palms. Fab reports inspected: conifer saplings, Kite, ground foliage, meadow flowers,
ferns, grasses, spruce and palms. No suitable desert pack was found. No licensed files are
committed. A full license-absent scenario passes **35/35**, exit 0, with console/network/runtime
errors **0/0/0** (`/tmp/worlds-cc0.log`); all existing local served asset roots were hidden for
the run and restored by the exit trap. Captures are in `artifacts/playtest/worlds-cc0/`.
Fallback frame-window p50: meadow **1.7 ms**, overview **1.8 ms**, alpine **1.5 ms**, desert
**1.0 ms**, tundra **1.2 ms**. Its ocean visual checks also pass. Direct `?world=alpine` startup
passes **6/6** with zero errors (`/tmp/worlds-url.log`, captures in `artifacts/playtest/worlds-url/`).
The final example build passes and emits three separate lazy world chunks; the existing main
chunk is 13.7 MB and each new world chunk is 4.7–4.9 MB before gzip, so lazy loading does not
mean a small initial bundle. Documentation link checks and six document/CI-contract test files
pass (**180 tests**).

Honest visual verdict: **improved, below Unreal/Gaia**. Alpine has the ridge/snow/treeline
composition but still lacks Gaia's irregular exposed bedrock and bright snow fans; desert
mesa walls need stronger geological detail; tundra's vegetation remains coarse and its ice lake
is absent. AC-5 stays open, including final art/atmosphere and the per-starter cooked budget.
Native is unverified. The 1.5 GiB worktree is retained for unpushed commits, local licensed art and browser captures.

### AC-5 round 9 — coastal, sky and distance (2026-10-02)

Complexity 1 → LOW; existing factory wiring is unchanged. Capability search/detail
covered SpectralOcean, WaterSurface3D, WaveField and Daylight before material work.
Retained sea: calmer spectral swell, fragment noise-gradient normals ported from the
existing river approach, PBR sky radiance/Fresnel and real directional sun glitter.
The shared sun is now 35° and northerly so its reflection enters the coastal framing.
A baked distance/deep-water connection mask confines surf to a thin exposed shore;
dry sand bars stop propagation into lagoons. Crest ellipses are removed. The dense
inner sea grid stretches out to 4.1 km with wave/detail fading, removing the short,
striped horizon. Alpha dissolves across the shoreline; existing terrain wetness is
retained. The soft noise cloud deck uses optical thickness and sunward density samples.
Distant geometry gets secondary crags and sharper ridges. Three's installed
distance/height fog nodes add valley haze below 115 m without a render pass, with
the previous fog restored on scene cleanup. Lake reflection resolution
is 0.5 → 1 with the existing two-frame cadence, filtered taps and stronger subtle
ripples; cooler silt/scatter and red absorption remove the muddy water-body tint.

Final frozen-source WebGPU run: **24/24 assertions PASS, 0 console errors**, NVIDIA
Turing, 1920×1080. Meadow/overview engine frame p50 **2.3/2.3 ms** (CPU/frame metric,
not presented FPS). Existing ocean wave/sun checks PASS: **66.1% / 53.7%** changed
qualified water pixels. Added sheltered-water check rejects the actual round-8
capture (**0/63000** blue lagoon pixels) and passes the retained capture (**100%**).
Example typecheck, root Biome error gate and diff whitespace check PASS. Captures:
`examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/web/` — `coastal-ocean.png`,
`coastal-horizon-sea.png`, `coastal-sun-alt.png`, `river.png`, `forest-walk.png`.
Inspected at full resolution. An in-progress fifth capture timed out after a
type-only Vite reload; browser doctor checks passed and the frozen-source rerun
completed cleanly. Licensed bytes and other lane files are untouched;
procedural/CC0 paths receive the same materials. Native and a new no-pack run are
unverified for this round. **Below the Unreal/Gaia target; AC-5 stays open.**

Other-lane handoff: the rectangular slab comes from `scatter.ts`'s >43° `cliff`
placement and the pack's 18 m variant, not a coastal render placement. The dark
mountain stripe is consistent with `terrain.ts`'s unbounded clamped wet-bank sample:
the actual south boundary has **11 wet cells, x=-88…-68, z=-256**, which extend as a
strip outside the bake. Fade `wetBank` to zero outside the resident extent. That same
file owns the distant rock/snow colour override; it currently replaces mapped albedo
with procedural grey, so textured mountain layering needs the terrain lane. These
files were not edited. Rejected straight and warped analytic short-wave trials both
showed corduroy; retained the existing river's noise-gradient detail instead.

### AC-5 forest round 9 — 2026-10-02

Game-owned materials now reduce needle specular/glow, apply radial crown AO, prefer full
spruces (9/11 selections), shorten half-crown variants, and repair the all-zero normals in
`spruce_full_03_low` at load and preparation. Cooked KTX2 inspection finds sRGB albedo
(DFD transfer 2) and linear normals (transfer 1); no second colour conversion was added.
Rock burial increases to 32% with noisy base/up-facing moss. Flowers are approximately
one-third shorter, with a green lift confined to dark stem/seed texels. Cover scatters to
62 m around benchmark eyes and thins deterministically over 28–112 m. Ground gains
smaller macro patches and slope/curvature soil/rock; curvature's dark striping is reduced.
The cutout scalar now reaches the shadow override, so crown shadows discard empty atlas
texels. Shadow softness/clip selection remain in the separately owned sky rig.

Browser `terrain.playtest.json` on port 5187: **24/24 PASS, 0 console errors**;
meadow/overview engine frame p50 **2.4/2.7 ms**, both below 8 ms. Full 1920×1080
captures: `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round9-backfaces/`.
Example typecheck, root Biome error gate, existing `scripts/check-temperate.mts`,
prep-script syntax and diff whitespace checks pass. Initial baseline 504 optimize-dep
errors cleared on the next run. **AC-5 stays open**: cyan underside highlights, broad
far-ground fill and the shadow clip boundary need another pass. Parallel overview ribs
remain baked geometry (`scripts/bake.mjs` mountain/billow/erosion), outside this lane.
No licensed bytes staged; no push; native and full asset recook unverified.

Second working increment keeps the crowns lit, removes canopy specular completely,
warms/darkens only opaque branches, and grades needles greener. Diffuse-only and
fog-disabled diagnostics did not resolve the cyan interiors and were discarded.
Metre-scale continuous grass colour now survives distant texture mips; a stronger
thresholded experiment produced camouflage and was discarded. `round9-cover` passes
**24/24, 0 console errors**, meadow/overview p50 **2.4/2.5 ms**. Typecheck and the
root Biome error gate pass. Full 1920×1080 captures live in
`examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round9-cover/`.
Independent visual review finds improved canopy colour, rock contact and flower scale,
but cyan-grey crown interiors and yellow-olive hilltops still miss the reference.

Final lane increment reduces the dry ground's red multiplier from 1.35 to 1.05,
strengthens continuous moss at rock contacts, adds patchy growth on upward faces,
and caps crown sky AO at 0.12–0.58 (interior–exterior). The shaded crown is darker,
but this does **not** resolve its cyan-grey response. Albedo replaced by fixed green
on masked leaves and then every tree section, followed by fully opaque leaf cards,
retains the blue shaded faces. This rules out needle albedo and background gaps as
sole causes; the lighting source remains unresolved. Upward-bent normals worsen the
white sheen and were discarded. Every diagnostic material override is removed.

The parallel overview gullies survive constant ground albedo, geometric normals and
material AO disabled: `artifacts/playtest/round9-geometry-diagnostic/overview.png`.
They are geometry in the baked heightfield; this lane leaves the bake recipe alone.
The scalar alpha-test fix reaches crown shadow overrides, but the sheared shadow's
softness/clip selection is not claimed fixed: the player chase camera changes its
framing between runs. The separately owned sky rig retains bias/normalBias and clip
selection; no engine or sky code changed.

Final `round9-crown-ao` run: **24/24 PASS, 0 console errors, no diagnostics**;
meadow/overview engine frame p50 **2.6/3.2 ms**, both below 8 ms. Full 1920×1080
captures: `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round9-crown-ao/`.
Example typecheck and root Biome error gate pass. Existing temperate procedural
geometry/placement checks pass; preparation syntax and the targeted zero-normal
repair exercise pass (51,594 repaired normals, none zero). The whole licensed
library recook and native runtime remain unverified. No licensed bytes committed;
no push. Verdict: improved forest material/cover/contact/flower scale, **below the
Unreal/Gaia target; AC-5 remains open**. This active PR checkout is retained for the
other lane and later acceptance work.


### AC-5 forest round 10 — 2026-10-02 (bounded round complete)

Bounded continuation in the existing forest checkout (100 minutes; no push): first
ablate needle-only indirect fill and hemisphere colours, then retain an evidence-led
foliage light fix; fade the wet-bank mask at its resident boundary; reuse existing
PBR layers for continuation ridges; exclude unembeddable coastal cliffs; vary the
forest bake's drainage only if the lake/river remain in their basin. Appearance stays
in the example. The global sky rig and other biome recipe definitions stay intact.
Proof: shared 1920×1080 browser scenario (all diagnostics, p50 below 8 ms), example
typecheck and root Biome per working commit; terrain tests and spike check after bake.
First working increment: `buildCurvature` fades wetBank over the last two resident
cells, reaching zero at/outside the bake boundary; `triplanarAlbedo` supplies existing
grass/rock/snow maps at 12/6/8× tile scales on continuation ridges. No sampler is added.
Cliffs require an inland bare scarp across the scaled footprint; coastal placement is
excluded. `check-temperate.mts` passes (3,200 spruces, 1 qualifying inland cliff,
0 cliffs in the coastal placement control). Example typecheck and root Biome error
gate pass. Browser visual/assertion qualification is pending: the other lane holds
the shared capture lease; no successful full-scenario run is claimed yet.
Second working increment: review found a rotated cliff corner crossing grass. The
filter now checks a conservative 3×3 yaw envelope of the pack stone's normalized
maximum dimension. The placement check passes with 0 forest/coastal cliffs and a
positive continuous-scarp fixture; the demonstrated rotated-corner placement is
rejected. A fresh read-only review finds no remaining concrete guard defect.
The forest-only `drainage-breakup` warped noise precedes hydraulic erosion. Bake
and spike scripts pass (2 spikes, worst 1.5 m); all 69 terrain tests pass. Lake
centre stays below water (11.2015 → 11.2158 m versus 12.4 m); wet cells inside its
radius change 994 → 987 and the river remains downhill. Coastal baked data is
byte-equivalent. The basin did not require retracing. Local overview relief varies
more, but the distant parallel ribs still need work; this is partial visual progress.
The full candidate (including the pending crown material) passes 24/24 assertions,
0 console errors, meadow/overview frame p50 2.2/2.4 ms at 1920×1080. Captures:
`examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round10-candidate/`.
Crown visuals are still being qualified before their commit. Example typecheck,
root Biome error gate and document checks pass. The first root Biome invocation
had an import-order error in an uncommitted probe; it was corrected and rerun
successfully before this increment. No native or Unreal-level visual claim.
Third working increment: needle-only fill ablations retain substantial grey; fill
colour alone is not the whole cause. `lightNeedles` supplies green scattered
ambient multiplied by the crown's AO, and albedo-coloured backlight using
`pow(saturate(dot(-viewDir,sunDir)),3)` with an exterior/AO gate. It wraps Three's
existing direct-light model, whose incoming sun colour is already shadowed; no
extra light list, shadow sampler or global sky appearance change remains. Both
licensed cutouts and procedural/CC0/fallback needles use the shared helper.
An early raw-shadow read in emissive whitened the forest→coast handoff despite
passing behavioural assertions. A cold coastal control was green; replacing
that read with visibility 1 restored the handoff. The retained direct-light
implementation preserves the stock shadow path and green coastal crowns.
Final callback run `round10-crown`: PASS 24/24 assertions, 0 console errors;
meadow/overview frame p50 2.7/2.9 ms, hardware WebGPU, original 1920×1080 captures.
Paths: `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round10-crown/`.
Typecheck and root Biome pass after correcting the installed direct callback's
two-argument signature and narrowing its generic Node values to vec3; the final
narrowing changes types only. Read-only review passes the shadow/lighting strategy.
Verdict: the dominant forest cyan is reduced; pale inner branch patches and
repetitive distant ribs still prevent an Unreal-level acceptance claim.
Fourth working increment: the remaining distant comb also came from straight
extrusion of baked perimeter heights through the horizon's 480 m transition.
Forest continuation now fades fine perimeter detail over 45 m into a cached,
triangularly averaged edge profile, then into the existing massif. The exact
collider seam and coastal continuation are preserved. A first domain-warped
continuation introduced an exposed strip and was rejected; the retained filtered
version removes the conspicuous parallel ribs without that strip. The existing
temperate check now verifies the exact inner seam and finite horizon coordinates.
Read-only review of original 1920×1080 overview/river captures passes this bounded
relief improvement; it does not certify Unreal-level art.
Fallback qualification: a temporary Vite transform disabled licensed pack models,
prepared prop models and vegetation textures at their loaders, leaving source and
local assets untouched. The same scenario passes 24/24 assertions with 0 console
errors and meadow/overview frame p50 1.6/1.8 ms. Captures:
`examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round10-fallback/`.
The untextured fallback remains functional, with visibly pale, angular foliage;
its art is not equivalent to the licensed arm.
The first filtered licensed run has 0 console errors and 2.3/2.5 ms p50, but only
22/24 assertions: automatic quality selected low and excluded the AO stage,
failing render-chain stage/contribution diagnostics. A fresh forced-capture-lease
run `round10-final-green` passes 24/24 assertions including both AO diagnostics,
with 0 console/network errors, no runtime diagnostics, hardware WebGPU and
meadow/overview frame p50 2.2/2.8 ms. The sky/AO configuration is unchanged;
contention is a possible explanation of the earlier tier drop, not a proven cause.
Final 1920×1080 captures:
`examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/round10-final-green/`
(`river.png`, `overview.png`, `coastal-ocean.png`). Typecheck, root Biome error
gate, temperate geometry/placement check, document checks and six prescribed
document suites pass. No licensed assets are committed and no push is performed.
Verdict: the five reported defects have bounded improvements, including removal
of the wet-bank boundary smear and placed coastal cliff slab. Pale inner crown
cards, overly vivid foliage patches and soft distant material detail still fall
below the Unreal/Gaia target. Forest→coast colours survive the handoff; the lake
and downhill river remain in the basin. Native rendering is unverified this round.
AC-5 remains open pending visual acceptance of all five environments.


### Phase 4: Starter world kits — the agent handoff

**Status:** OPEN (owner direction 2026-10-05)

**Why:** the product is the handoff. Another agent asks "I am making an xyz game, generate a W
terrain" and receives something ready to use that its game can still edit: tree colliders, models,
placements and look. The preview example only proves it. Measured gaps on 2026-10-05: the package
ships no starter worlds (`packages/terrain/starter/` was never created) and no art (`starter-assets/`
is outside `files`); `exportWorldGLB` is browser-only and rejects instancing, so a GLB-only handoff
caps the look at plain `MeshStandardMaterial`, loses per-placement data in the asset pipeline's
instance batches and cannot carry colliders; the forest look tuned so far rests on 1.3 GB of licensed
local Fab art that cannot ship.

**Decision:** a kit is editable source plus baked data, copied into the asking game, not an opaque
file and not an MCP tool (agents reach it through the existing capability search; a tool would wrap
a copy and a bake). Per world, `packages/terrain/starter/<world>/` holds the recipe document, a bake
script writing heights, splat colours and placements (stable ids, asset, transform), and render/world
source with one entry that adds terrain, instanced props, water and collision to a ThreeNative scene.
Colliders are a per-asset table in that copied source (`spruce: capsule`, `boulder: convex`, ...), so
editing tree colliders is a one-line game edit. Art is the CC0 `starter-assets` set, shared across
kits. The browser GLB export stays the path for other engines and tools.

**Files:** `packages/terrain/starter/`, `packages/terrain/package.json` (`files`),
`packages/terrain/__tests__/starter-kit.spec.ts`, example `src/` consuming the kit,
`scripts/verify-consumer.mjs` (fresh-game adoption), terrain-authoring agent docs and capabilities.

- [ ] K1: The forest kit ships in the packed `@threenative/terrain` and a freshly scaffolded game adopts it with no authoring package at runtime: copy, bake, add; terrain, instanced CC0 props and water draw; the character stands on the ground and a tree collider from the per-asset table stops it; no external request. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/terrain/__tests__/starter-kit.spec.ts` plus `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:consumer`.
- [ ] K2: The adopted forest kit holds 60 FPS: every benchmark view GPU p95 ≤ 14 ms and CPU frame p95 ≤ 16.7 ms on hardware WebGPU (RTX 2080, timestamp query, private Xvfb), cooked kit ≤ 25 MiB. proof: the fresh-game playtest's per-view budget observations.
- [ ] K3: The adopted forest kit's captures pass every rubric row (ground, trees and rocks, lighting and depth) by a fresh judge subagent, before/after posted on the PR. proof: fresh-game captures plus the judge verdict.
- [ ] K4: Coastal, alpine, desert and tundra kits meet K1–K3, the tundra kettles as an ice surface. proof: the same commands per world.
- [ ] K5: An agent asked for "a W terrain for my game" reaches a playing world from the installed docs and capability search alone. proof: `test:consumer` capability lookup plus one cold-agent run recorded on the PR.

#### Phase 4 forest kit, round 1 (2026-10-05; K1 rows green, boxes open until the committed `test:kit` reruns)

- Kit: `packages/terrain/starter/forest/` = `recipe.json`, `bake.mjs` → engine WorldCells package via new
  `bakeWorldPackage` (`0f4054be5`, specs round-trip through core's validator and sampler), `world.ts`
  (`addForest`: `loadTerrainSplat` + `WorldCells` + one full-world heightfield + per-asset `COLLIDERS`),
  `sky.ts` (`Daylight`, ACES). CC0 art: Poly Haven fir_tree_01 authored LOD2 (54,927 tris, full crown;
  the old card-dropping prep kept 0.3% of the silhouette), boulder_01 authored LOD1/LOD2, Kloofendal 1k
  HDRI as prop envMap. Baked forest world 8.1 MB cooked (≤ 25 MiB).
- `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:kit` (fresh scaffold, packed tarballs, NVIDIA/turing, 1920×1080):
  groundError 0.036 m, driven 3.28 m, stopped 0.72 m from the fir axis (0.35 + 0.35 m capsules),
  2,740 prop colliders, firs drawn, no console errors, no failed requests. Per view GPU p50/p95 and
  CPU frame p95: ground 5.7/5.9 and 3.0 ms, edge 10.9/11.6 and 2.6 ms, overview 13.9/14.5 and 3.6 ms —
  overview misses the K2 14 ms GPU bar.
- Engine findings from the fresh game: (1) `WorldCells` `samplesFramebuffer` copied every typed array it
  walked (`Object.values`), so an HDR envMap on a streamed prop cost 4.07 s of a 4.33 s CPU profile (5 fps);
  fixed with a red→green spec (`7bd7c84a4`). (2) The default GPU-culled `WorldCells` path drops near
  firs from the main pass while their shadows draw; the kit sets `gpuScene: false` like the preview —
  open. (3) A splat texture path that does not resolve stalled startup at 0% with "nothing outstanding"
  instead of failing — open, cause unconfirmed. (4) Streamed terrain colliders arrive after a spawned
  player falls through; the kit builds one heightfield before `addForest` resolves.

#### Phase 4 forest kit, rounds 2–4 (2026-10-05)

- Engine fixes from the fresh game: impostor atlas V flip (`b962f8df1`); impostor instance sync on a
  FRAME event, since three skips OBJECT updates for settled static batches (`0fed4b81d`) — far firs
  now draw world-wide. Kit: streamed prop colliders (60 m), crown-bent foliage normals, matte foliage,
  fir b + fir c mix, lighter haze. Pine LOD2 rejected (416k tris).
- `test:kit` (committed harness) passes: groundError 0.039 m, stopped 0.81 m from the trunk, 198 live
  prop colliders, 9,986 firs drawn, 8.6 MB cooked. K1 stays open on one clause: the forest kit has no
  water body (the recipe's lake/river were removed because nothing drew them).
- Judge: 2/10 → 3/10 → 3/10 (rounds 1, 3, 4); all three rubric rows still fail (dark card crowns,
  single-layer ground without cover, impostor smear from high cameras, washed overview).
- FPS (K2): GPU timer 8–15 ms per view at 1080p; the playtest's per-view frame p95 includes bridge
  sampling of a ~9k-instance scene. Unharnessed rAF on private Xvfb ≈10 fps with Chrome's GPU process
  at 101% CPU, GPU ~30%, 4,754 of 5,000 ms in `SwapBuffers` (present path; blank page 60). On the
  owner's display (Xwayland :0) both the kit AND the current original preview game present at exactly
  1 fps. The October 3 preview result was p50 60 FPS, mean 36 FPS and interval p95 50 ms;
  it did not prove sustained 60 FPS. The current preview shares later engine changes, and a blank
  page does not exercise WebGPU presentation, so these controls do not isolate an environment cause.
  K2 open.

#### Phase 4 performance measurement repair (2026-10-06; K2 remains open)

- At `d7838323129b4a75fca6c1c52ba5add102ca71e1`, an explicit
  `TN_PLAYTEST_HOST_DISPLAY=1` request checked only the filesystem X socket and silently used
  private Xvfb when that path was absent. That misclassifies abstract-only Xwayland displays.
  The runner now verifies the X connection with `xdpyinfo` and fails by name when the requested
  display cannot be used. Focused display tests: 14 baseline passed; six contract failures
  reproduced; 19 passed after the fix. This repairs measurement provenance, not FPS.
- The retained `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/starter-kit/capture.json` and
  `console.json` record NVIDIA/turing, 1920×1080 and disabled GPU vsync/frame limits, but no
  display provenance. Their frame windows include 229 long tasks (longest 903 ms),
  stale GPU samples and short manually driven intervals. Median CPU window p95 values alone
  cannot qualify K2 or prove displayed throughput.
- Next controlled comparison: the current immutable packed kit, a frozen earlier build with its
  exact engine, and a minimal hardware WebGPU animation, with identical display, Chromium flags
  and resolution. Record passive presentation intervals separately from CPU callback duration
  and GPU timestamps; rAF cadence alone does not establish displayed throughput. If the kit
  differs from the minimal control, hold one scene and its assets constant while swapping
  frozen/current engine builds before attributing the regression to engine or content. Compare
  bridge enabled/disabled only if those controls implicate it. GPU execution awaits a
  coordinated resource window.

## Verification and delivery

Phase 1 implementation: `packages/terrain/src/index.ts` is headless, and
`packages/terrain/src/three.ts` is the geometry-only consumer entry. The optional
package is discovered by the existing workspace/release scans; no core dependency
or custom release list was added. `pnpm --filter @threenative/terrain test` passes
7 consumer tests and both ordinary/strict publint. The approximately 3,700 typed
source lines recover the supplied evaluator/codecs rather than duplicate an
installed system; the geometry adapter is 25 lines and chooses no appearance.
The kill-switch review retained the supplied algorithms and reused the ordinary
Three.js geometry classes and package build/release discovery.

Repository integration: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`,
`pnpm capabilities:check`, `pnpm budgets` and `pnpm check:docs` pass. The
`pnpm test` package phase passes after native contract prerequisites were built;
`pnpm gate:resume` reruns the failed unit phase successfully: 520 files, 6,468
tests pass; 3 files/12 tests are existing skips. Six prescribed docs suites pass
180 tests; the changed mirror/CI suites pass 149 tests. The full suite also
identified the required README package row, generated release comment, scoped
package test selector and a reasoned waiver for the exact supplied noise
coefficient; those integration fixes pass 15 targeted tests and retain compatibility. Those full-repository results used the original `0625f0f26` develop baseline.
The PR branch subsequently received develop commit `7d8367a58`; the terrain
consumer suite (7 tests), package integration suites (15 tests), strict publint
and capability regeneration pass again on the preserved merged baseline. Full
repository checks will be refreshed with the next behavior phase. The subsequently rerun browser/native scenarios verify rendering/contact and
coastal wave/lighting behavior. Editor, starter-art and full-world export remain open.


Commands naming the new package, example, tests, and `test:terrain:*` /
`test:consumer` scripts are **implementation targets**, not shipped commands today.
Each wrapper must invoke the existing harness; do not create another runner. Run
`pnpm prd:progress` before execution and after each phase. Tick only verified work.

Behavior work uses genuine red/green against public consumer paths. Final affected
repository gates include `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`,
`pnpm budgets`, and the selected existing CI/native gates. Document changes receive
the existing docs checks and necessary mirror regeneration. Keep results on the
owning boxes/PR, not separate verification reports.

One implementation PR targets `develop`, opened as a draft before phase 1 starts.
Use an owning-repository worktree, update its progress label, and archive this PRD
only after all nine boxes have current evidence. Overall requested integration
also requires PRD-467; do not describe a runtime-only delivery as editor completion.
It also requires PRD-468; live atmosphere/cameras/imports are part of the request.
Publishing requires its own
explicit authorization; packing tarballs and exercising a local install do not.

Scaffold instruction progress (2026-09-30): all ten template AGENTS files link to
`node_modules/create-threenative/agent-docs/references/terrain-authoring.md`;
their generated CLAUDE mirrors include the same guidance. The shipped guide
covers the optional authoring dependency, existing public Terrain/Mask/bake
imports, stable recipe edits, caller-owned materials, triangle/collision units,
and keeping evaluation out of the game loop. Template/mirror suites pass 48
checks (including all ten pristine scaffold typechecks), documentation links pass,
and the six prescribed documentation suites pass 180 checks. Live editor
installation/controller instructions and packed editor/scaffold proof remain
pending; AC-7 stays open until those APIs land.

The updated scaffold-tree snapshot passes all 60 scaffold checks after the
intentional AGENTS/CLAUDE instruction change. Root typecheck, lint and budgets
pass; the generated bake is ignored by Biome rather than increasing its input
size limit. Full refresh on the integrated develop baseline passes 520 unit files / 6,476
tests (3 files / 12 existing skips), plus workspace builds and package checks.
The subsequent game clock wiring is covered by the rerun example typecheck and
shared runtime scenario; no new full-suite verdict is claimed for that edit.

Phase 2 visual refresh (2026-10-01): both target scripts include the runnable
`verify-ocean.mjs` check, reusing the native conformance PNG inspector. Browser
and native shoreline/wave/sun captures are inspected and attached to PR #381.
The shoreline refresh passes root typecheck, lint, budgets and doc links; six
documentation suites pass 180 tests. Root `pnpm test` completes workspace/package
checks and 6,475 unit tests, with one source-hygiene failure because a removed
tracked palette file had not yet been staged. Staging that deletion fixes the
index-based scan; its one test then passes. This reports the actual full-command
failure and targeted repair, not a cached or invented full-command success.


Static-world export milestone (2026-10-01): `@threenative/terrain/export`
uses the installed GLTFExporter for ordinary shared-mesh nodes and embedded byte
PBR images. The caller supplies canonical terrain, actual static models and final
grounded placement matrices. Six public guards reject unresolved models/matrices,
noncanonical geometry, nonpositive/sheared poses, invisible models, unbaked
shader/displacement surfaces, missing/wrong-role PBR maps, malformed RGBA data,
object-space/anisotropic normals and missing/stale/incoherent water. DOM-free
imports remain separate from browser FileReader/canvas encoding. Frozen geometry,
images and materials prevent source edits from mixing the asynchronous snapshot.

The real renderer exports 100 actual final placement matrices, including saved
position `[12,100,-4]`, 90-degree yaw, nonuniform scale `[2,.5,1.5]` and grounding
false. The 1,218,368-byte GLB encodes in 301 ms in the observed run. A temporary
consumer installs only the packed installed Three.js, loads through GLTFLoader
and compares every component of all 100 matrices. Four embedded PNG PBR bindings,
101 meshes, shared model mesh data, no external image/buffer URIs, no required
instancing extension and no cameras/animations are verified. The vanilla capture
uses WebGLRenderer on Mesa llvmpipe; producer WebGPU provenance must not be used
to claim consumer WebGPU or hardware FPS. An ordinary ThreeNative Linux game
with no terrain authoring imports loads that same GLB through `ctx.assets.model`;
its actual scene/resource observations and inspected screenshot pass. Eleven
static decoded-content assertions declare their held-invariant reasons; the frame
counter must change during the scenario.

This is a bounded interchange proof with 16-pixel test maps, not final starter
art. The producer first refuses its unresolved river without changing the saved
revision, then explicitly removes it from the temporary fixture for successful
static-world proof. Chosen-resolution evaluation/material/deformation baking,
coherent ocean/river export, the default GUI action, all five realistic starter
exports and packed-scaffold handoff remain open. The generated API/capability
snapshots and shipped addon guide now name the explicit `/export` contract.
Actual vanilla/native/reassignment screenshots are tracked under
`docs/verification/visuals/strata/` and will be attached to PR #381.

### AC-5 Alpine / Desert / Tundra round 2 (2026-10-02)

Complexity: 2 → LOW; risk override: none. Bounded example appearance changes using
installed Terrain operations and shared prop/water rendering. AC-5 remains open.

1. Replace rounded landforms with arêtes/cirques, mesa caprock/benches and moraine/kettle drainage.
2. Break rock repetition, place snow by slope/exposure and dress optional props per biome.
3. Capture defining views at 1920×1080, compare forest luminance and measure frame-window p50.

Proof: bake, spike measurement, terrain Vitest; example typecheck and root Biome per commit;
shared terrain scenario with zero console errors. Decisions: ridged noise already ships;
thaw-season liquid tundra pools; licensed local art remains optional with procedural/CC0
fallbacks. Forest/coast recipes stay untouched. No push or native claim.

First round-2 increment: shared scenario **36/36 PASS**, zero diagnostics/console errors
(`/tmp/worlds-r2-pass3.log`, `artifacts/playtest/worlds-r2-pass3/`), NVIDIA Turing WebGPU
at 1920×1080. Frame-window p50 meadow/overview/alpine/desert/tundra: **2.2/2.4/1.3/1.1/2.0 ms**.
The scenario now observes two drawn kettle-pond material groups and waits for actual water triangles.
Terrain Vitest: **69/69 PASS**. Example typecheck and root Biome error gate pass.
Spike counts alpine/desert/tundra: **30/11/0**, worst **2.7/2.3/0 m**. Forest meadow display
luminance p5/p50/p95: baseline **15.5078/77.0686/176.5044**, increment
**15.4356/77.0658/176.5044**, all differences below 0.5. Forest/coast recipes are unchanged.

The initial steep alpine experiment produced 151 spikes and vertical pillars; lower hydraulic
capacity/bite and low-rate thermal settling reduced them (the first increment still masked talus;
the second removes that mask). Multi-lake rendering previously
threw at tundra entry (pass1); it now merges ordinary geometry with one material group per pond,
advancing and disposing each existing water surface. Desert optional Kite variant 0 is no longer
overwritten by its CC0 fallback. Colour and normal projections share rotations and tile scales.

Read-only review confirmed these fixes but found remaining water-footprint/prop-exclusion and
river-width mismatches for the new tundra channels. Inspected captures remain below Gaia/Unreal:
alpine still reads too broad and grey with weak snow/cirques; desert strata/dunes are regular;
tundra needs clearer patterned ground and less regular cover. AC-5 stays open; a visual follow-up
within this round is next. A run interrupted by edits timed out during a screenshot (pass2); it is
not evidence. No licensed bytes committed, no push, native unverified.

Second working increment: pass6 **36/36 PASS**, zero diagnostics/console errors before the
braid correction; frame p50 meadow/overview/alpine/desert/tundra **2.4/2.8/1.3/1.0/1.9 ms**
(`/tmp/worlds-r2-pass6.log`, `artifacts/playtest/worlds-r2-pass6/`). Broader arêtes and
fracture noise remove the most conspicuous alpine needles; sandstone front light, rotated
rock sampling, patterned tundra ground and bounded/faded ponds improve definition. The
caps are still uneven and the water/rock appearance remains below the reference.

Read-only review exposed a real shared ribbon bug: the second river's local wet array was
indexed with global vertex indices, dropping all its quads. Synthetic two-channel proof
failed **144 versus expected 288 indices**, then passes **144/288** after subtracting the
base. A flooded tundra scatter fixture failed with **1,659 submerged plants**, then passes
with **0** after excluding the interpolated stream footprint. The persistent scenario now
waits for two non-empty river index groups. This latest browser rerun and licensed-absent
fallback are pending; no unrun acceptance is checked. Terrain Vitest remains **69/69 PASS**;
example typecheck and root Biome error checks pass for this increment. Forest pass5
luminance **15.4986/76.9828/176.5004** remains within 0.5 of baseline. AC-5 stays open.

Third working increment: pass7 **36/36 PASS**, zero diagnostics/console errors; both
river index groups now contain triangles. Frame p50 meadow/overview/alpine/desert/tundra:
**2.2/2.2/1.3/1.1/1.8 ms**. Tundra streams now reuse the kettle ponds' existing mirrors,
blended by elevation; no new reflection pass. Pack-free run with this shader passed all
assertions, zero diagnostics/console errors, p50 **2.4/2.3/1.3/1.0/2.1 ms**; licensed data
was restored. Its oversized procedural saplings motivated measured fallback heights of
2 m alpine / 1.4 m tundra, leaving licensed and temperate paths unchanged. The updated
pack-free rerun and final licensed captures both pass, as recorded below.

`pnpm exec tsx scripts/check-water.mjs` preserves the real two-channel, flooded-cover
and small-fallback-sapling checks; all pass. Example typecheck, Biome error gate and
example build pass. Terrain tests **69/69 PASS**. Higher alpine crag noise brought back
an isolated needle and raised spike count from 37 to 75; retain the previous broader
recipe (**37/9/0** spikes, worst **3.1/2.1/0 m**). Narrower rock fissure shading replaces
camouflage patches; sandstone colour bands follow the 8 m benches more subtly.

Broader checks: normal-state root lint passes. Root typecheck fails on unresolved
`@threenative/assets` and missing `.mjs` fixture declarations in untouched package
files; full suite reaches native tests but fails **21** assertions with absent host/test
binaries (**1,502 passed**, **70 skipped** in that lane). No native claim. A fallback
capture stopped during coastal while package-building tests ran; doctor passes, and a
quiet rerun passes. The suite's generated Abyss build report was restored; no unrelated
changes retained. AC-5 remains open: terrain/props still fall short of Gaia/Unreal.

Final round-2 proof: `artifacts/playtest/worlds-r2-final/` has **36/36 PASS**, zero
diagnostics/console errors. Frame p50 meadow/overview/alpine/desert/tundra is
**2.1/2.2/1.2/1.1/2.2 ms**. The updated procedural fallback also passes **36/36**, zero
errors, p50 **1.7/2.2/1.2/1.0/2.2 ms**, in `artifacts/playtest/worlds-r2-fallback/`;
licensed assets are restored and none committed. Forest meadow luminance p5/p50/p95
is **15.5102/77.0328/176.5686**, delta **+0.0024/-0.0358/+0.0642**, within 0.5.
Normal-state Biome passes after restoring local assets; the temporary renamed-asset
scan had formatting errors in licensed manifests, without source errors or edits.

Full-resolution fresh review rates alpine **6/10**, desert **5/10**, tundra **5/10**
against the requested target. Alpine still lacks layered cliff detail and continuous
snowfields; desert walls remain rounded; tundra cover and bright water lack reference
fidelity. Functional fallback is verified, visual parity is not. Reject the final
desert cliff-band experiment: spikes rose 9 to 14 (worst 2.1 to 4.1 m) with angular
notches; restore the already-green recipe. AC-5 stays open; Unreal quality is unmet.
Decisions: reuse existing ridged noise and pond mirrors; spring-thaw tundra water;
desert atmospheric haze without heat-shimmer distortion; retain stable broad landforms.
Worktree retained (3.2 GiB): active PR, unpushed increments and licensed local data.

#### 2026-10-02 V7 judge (merged forest r10 + worlds r2, bdb719570)

Full scenario green on the merge (exit 0, no console/network errors). Fresh judge subagent, full
resolution against the Gaia references: forest 3.5, coastal 4.5, alpine 3.5, desert 2.5, tundra 3.0,
**overall 3.6/10**. Top defects: foliage alpha fringe (white/blue specks on spruce and grass cards),
un-eroded smooth landforms with no cliff faces, blotchy dark AO/shadow patches, flat macro ground
tiling, tundra sky blow-out. The judge's "posterisation" claim on `river.png` did not reproduce at 1:1
(smooth gradients; the defect there is a featureless horizon mountain). Captures:
`docs/verification/visuals/strata/v7-*.jpg` (superseded by v8). AC-5 stays open.


### AC-5 Worlds round 3 — mesh-led rock faces (2026-10-02)

Complexity: 2 → LOW; risk override: none. Game-owned appearance and build recipes;
reuse installed asset cook, InstancedBatch, GroundSnap, Heightfield and Terrain.
Local lanes below. No push/merge; licensed source and cooked bytes remain ignored.

1. Import optional mountain/volcanic/reveal scans and RockFace003; embed overlapping,
   slope-oriented crags, and retain missing-file fallback.
2. Author narrow mesa walls/caps/talus, alpine gullies/slope snow, clustered tundra
   cover and bounded sky radiance. Diagnose plain stripes and pale plant bases.
3. Judge six fresh 1920×1080 views; preserve forest/coast luminance quantiles within
   0.5 and frame-window p50 ≤4 ms at each defining/overview view.

Proof: example tsc, root example Biome, terrain Vitest, full terrain scenario with
licensed assets and without them. Results and honest visual grades follow here;
AC-5 stays open until the requested visual bar is actually met.


Working increment: 69/69 terrain Vitest, example tsc and root example Biome pass.
`check-water.mjs` passes: both braids draw, zero flooded dry cover, bounded fallback saplings.
Pass1 scenario 36/36 PASS, zero errors/diagnostics, p50 forest meadow/overview and
alpine/desert/tundra defining views: 2.4/3.4/2.0/1.3/2.5 ms
(`artifacts/playtest/worlds-r3-pass1/`). Full-resolution review exposed `.glb.glb`
new scan requests (procedural shapes drew); fixed before pass2. Pass1 is not licensed
crag evidence. Narrow mesa walls and bounded tundra halo draw; broad foliage mats
shimmer and read too dark, so width/specular and ground irradiance were retuned.

Baseline scenario 36/36 PASS, zero diagnostics, before source edits:
`artifacts/playtest/worlds-r3-baseline/`. Early forest/coast quantile differences in
pass1 exceed the 0.5 target at meadow-close and coastal-ocean; preservation is not
claimed yet. Original forest/coast recipes and render choices remain untouched.
Six view p50 ceilings and actual crag-draw observations are now in the shared scenario;
the enhanced scenario and final licensed/fallback lanes remain pending.

The initial 2K rock cook measured 159.8 MiB and failed the 120 MB cap. New rock textures
only were reduced to 1K; fresh output measures 122.7 MiB (128.7 MB). The unavoidable
output selection raises the decimal cap by 10 MB to 130 MB. Prior generated output is
retained in ignored `.temperate-r3-first-cook/`; no licensed bytes are staged.

Pass2 enhanced full scenario: 40/40 PASS, zero errors/diagnostics; six p50s
alpine 2.1/1.9, desert 1.2/1.1, tundra 2.4/2.3 ms. Licensed crags
actually draw (alpine 414 placements, 2 parts; desert 113 volcanic placements,
6 parts). Full-resolution review rejects pasted-on rocks and pale foliage outlines.
Pass3 short iteration: 16/16 PASS; deeper burial/front lighting improve scan readability.
Preservation diagnosis: all-species recook added previously absent spruce/2,
spruce/2-far and sapling/2; forest triangles changed with identical placement/light.
Restore those missing aliases; bounded `--worlds` cook preserves existing species.
Quantile verification is pending. RockFace003 binding succeeds; pale tundra cards
are not a missing-map failure. Latest example tsc and source Biome pass.

Working increment 3: bounded cook verified with installed compiler: 8 new models,
121.6 MiB (127.5 MB), beneath 130 MB. Compiler replaces its output directory;
`--worlds` now cooks separately and merges, preserving old optional assets.
An overlapping cook invalidated pass4; that run also lost its renderer before
tundra. Doctor finds Node/Chromium/Xvfb available. Stable short pass5/pass6 and
flat probe pass 16/16; material-ready probes confirm ground and foliage bind.
White blades persist without photographic cards and without specular/received
shadow changes: those initial hypotheses are rejected. Final root occlusion is
applied after lighting/fog; the final capture must prove it. Alpine stripes
persist under constant albedo and fixed normal probes; radial horizon relief
is simplified/densified for the final candidate, with cause still unconfirmed.
Closed mountain faces avoid loose scan fringes; desert scans follow fall lines,
cap heights match the stamps, erosion is confined to the floor, and visible
strata use a 10.6 m broad band. Latest example tsc/Biome and 69 terrain tests
pass; final licensed/fallback and preservation measurements are pending.

Final licensed candidate (40/40 PASS, zero diagnostics; NVIDIA Turing WebGPU,
1920×1080): `artifacts/playtest/worlds-r3-final/`. Frame-window p50 ms:
alpine ridge/overview 2.2/2.5; desert mesa/overview 1.6/1.5; tundra plain/overview
2.4/2.0. All six full-resolution captures were inspected. Honest grades:
alpine 5/10 (continuous scans, but chunky repeats and smooth exposed base);
desert 4.5/10 (vertical walls/caps, but painted regular strata and sparse dressing);
tundra 3.5/10 (bounded sun halo, but pale bases and inadequate moss/low-cover fidelity).
AAA/Gaia is NOT achieved; AC-5 remains open.

Confirmed alpine stripe source: distant half-resolution, 8-sample screen-space AO.
Albedo/normal/shadow ablations retained banding; fading AO from 30 to 100 m removes
it in the final full-resolution ridge. Forest/coast keep their original AO recipe.
Tundra white bases remain unresolved: atlas, normal/specular, fog and root-output
experiments did not establish a sufficient fix; do not claim their root cause fixed.
The tundra-specific sky reduces the blown-out halo; ponds/braids still draw.

Preservation fails overall. Linear RGB-weighted luminance quantile differences
(p5/p50/p95, 0–255): forest meadow +0.439/-0.315/+0.136; overview
-0.362/-0.137/-0.138; startup -0.160/-0.626/-1.052; river
+0.016/-0.305/+0.928. Coastal ocean -0.783/-0.801/+0.154;
horizon +0.002/+0.053/0 and alternate sun 0/-0.289/0. Existing tree copies
reduced the recook drift but did not recover the original optional model identity.
Forest/coast render code and bake recipes are unchanged; asset preservation is unmet.

Requested example tsc, Biome and 69/69 terrain units PASS. Extra root lint exits 0
with existing warnings; root typecheck fails on missing declarations for unchanged
terrain `.mjs` fixtures. Extra root test attempt stopped at the worktree HEAD guard
because an increment was committed during its build; no root test pass is claimed.
Root builds also invalidated one capture; the final licensed run had no overlapping
build. Licensed/fallback directories are restored automatically after the final
fallback run, whose result is pending here until the runner completes.
### AC-5 forest/coast round 11 — 2026-10-02 (verified iteration; AC-5 open)

Bounded existing-source appearance work: forest/coastal only; no `biomes.ts`,
other-biome bake recipes or new rendering system. Reused material layers, seeded
scatter, GroundSnap, InstancedBatch, horizon noise and SpectralOcean. Licensed
source library stayed read-only; cooked bytes remain ignored. AC-5 stays open.

- [x] Inspect reference and isolate crown contamination; proof: full-resolution
  baseline, cooked mips and direct-MRT/raw-AO/alpha-preserved controls.
- [x] Repair confirmed causes and grade the final licensed views; proof: 38/38
  scenario assertions and original-resolution captures reviewed below.
- [x] Finish fallback and ocean/protected-biome checks; proof: both final scenarios
  38/38 PASS, both ocean verifiers PASS and protected quantile deltas ≤0.0678.

**Confirmed crown root cause:** the game-authored AO composition multiplied RGBA
by occlusion, lowering canvas alpha and leaking the pale backdrop through dark
crowns. Same-camera fresh MRT controls: direct colour clears the panels; raw AO
retains them; multiplying by `vec4(vec3(occlusion), 1)` clears them with AO/denoise
still installed. Left-crown cyan pixel share falls 31.99% → 5.83% (remaining sky
gaps); luminance median falls 54.60 → 18.13. Atlas white bleed is ruled out:
cooked 2048² spruce RGBA has 12 mips; visible white fraction at mips 0–5 is
3.1e-6/0/0/0/0/0. No atlas cook, normal-map or transmission changes retained.
Other worlds retain their original composition; original AO stage assertions pass.

Ground lawn appearance came from saturated uniform material blends and sparse
mid-distance cover. Temperate materials now use existing macro noise for dirt/moss,
roughness and muted colour; grass cell spacing is 1.2 m. Tree scale spans 0.6–1.4
in clustered age classes, with seeded lean and denser stand-edge saplings. Thin
bare trunks and mid/far cover still need visual judgment, not a completion claim.

Hillside smudges persist without AO, received shadows and normal relief: dark
shaded rock faces, not cloud shadows. Weathered rock colour and appearance bounce
soften them. Horizon mountain crests get existing noise-driven notches and erosion,
with grey rock instead of brown. Coastal foam coverage and wet-sand bands broaden;
coastal stones use existing scatter/props. Stone grounding now samples the scaled
footprint and sinks the base, avoiding the centre-only support that left overhangs.
Protected other-biome branches remain unchanged.

Final licensed shared scenario `artifacts/playtest/forest-r11-final/`: **PASS**,
zero failed assertions. Forest CPU frame p50 meadow/overview/river/player aggregate
is **2.5/2.5/3.4/3.7 ms**, all ≤4 ms. This measures CPU frame windows, not GPU
frame time. Six protected alpine/desert/tundra captures have luminance p05/p50/p95
absolute deltas **≤0.0678**, within 0.5 of supplied round-11 controls.

Example `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, root example Biome error gate, terrain tests
**69/69**, and temperate age/lean placement checks **PASS** on final source.
Earlier document checks: 2,386 links and six document test files (180 tests) PASS.
Licensed ocean visual check **PASS**: waves changed 63.82%, sun changed 53.40%,
sheltered-water blue fraction 100%. Baseline absent-licensed scenario **36/36 PASS**.
Final absent-licensed scenario `artifacts/playtest/forest-r11-final/fallback/`
**38/38 PASS**, zero diagnostics. Forest CPU p50 meadow/overview/river/player
aggregate **2.0/2.4/2.4/2.6 ms**, all ≤4 ms. Fallback ocean verifier **PASS**:
waves changed 66.61%, sun changed 53.61%, sheltered blue fraction 100%.

All six fallback protected-world capture luminance p05/p50/p95 absolute deltas
are **≤0.0650** against a separate absent-licensed `bdb719570` full-scenario
baseline. Alpine/desert/tundra therefore remain unchanged within the requested
0.5 tolerance in both asset modes. The local packs were moved reversibly to an
ignored folder outside asset lookup, then restored; final source was restored
before the candidate run. No licensed bytes, `biomes.ts` or bake recipes committed.
Coastal CPU window medians at ocean/horizon captures are **2.3/2.5 ms** licensed,
**1.7/1.6 ms** fallback; these are capture-window observations, not forest budgets.

Final view grades against Gaia/Unreal; both asset modes inspected at 1920×1080:

| View | Licensed | Fallback | Remaining visual limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| meadow-close | 7/10 | 4.5/10 | Dark crowns repaired; sparse flower cover and visibly built horizon slopes. |
| forest-walk | 5.5/10 | 4/10 | Muted ground still reads lawn-like at distance; exposed trunks and hill smudges remain. |
| overview | 6/10 | 4.5/10 | Age variation reads; canopy clumps and smooth distant ground still look procedural. |
| river | 7/10 | 4.5/10 | Clear crowns/reflections; uniform far slopes and partly bare bank cover. |
| coastal-ocean | 6.5/10 | 6/10 | Water/foam work; rounded shore relief and dark slope patches remain. |
| coastal-horizon-sea | 7/10 | 7/10 | Sheltered water preserved; shore still needs finer sediment and wet-band definition. |

The lower-crown/trunk concealment and hillside shading repairs are partial. The
forest-walk foreground stone is better embedded but retains a visible shelf on
its downhill side. The requested Unreal-level visual acceptance is **not met**;
AC-5 remains open. Fallback proves function, not licensed visual parity.

Delivery: final captures remain local in the requested directory; four implementation/
diagnosis commits plus this final notes commit are local, with no push or merge.
The worktree remains in use by the unfinished PRD/PR and retains licensed local data.

#### 2026-10-02 V8 judge (merged worlds r3 + forest r11, 52e99c409)

Full scenario green on both merges (exit 0, no console/network errors). Fresh judge, full resolution with
1:1 crops: forest 4.5, coastal 4.5, alpine 2.5, desert 3.0, tundra 3.0, **overall 3.8/10** (V7 3.6).
Crown cyan fringe gone (AO multiplied canvas alpha). Remaining: alpine crags read as a repeated boulder pile
on a smooth cone; threshold-stencil snow; desert strata as even horizontal bands with rocks on walls;
tundra Voronoi crack tiling; painted rock patches and lawn-like far meadow; clay-like coast land; weak
contact shadowing. Captures: `docs/verification/visuals/strata/v8-*.jpg` (superseded by v9). AC-5 stays open.
### AC-5 forest/coast round 12 — 2026-10-02 (verified iteration; AC-5 open)

Forest/coast source appearance only, from merged forest-round-11/worlds-round-3 tip.
Reuse WORLD_ROCKS, resident ground layers, deterministic scatter and GroundSnap.
Water, biomes.ts, otherBiome branches and other-world recipes are fixed.
Licensed originals are read-only; cooked bytes remain local and ignored.

- [x] Replace flat temperate rock patches with sunk 5–20 m cooked outcrops and matched ground; proof: final 1920×1080 overview/coast captures, 223 forest outcrops, one shared draw and green downhill-footprint exposure check.
- [x] Vary meadow/grass and repair bark/crown illumination and downhill boulder contact; proof: pass 2 42/42 PASS, crown-only control and final 1920×1080 meadow/walk inspection; brown trunks, root/tip/straw variation and slope-aligned foreground rock.
- [x] Complete licensed/fallback full scenarios on 5293, ocean check and protected quantiles ≤0.5; proof: both 42/42 PASS, both ocean checks PASS, licensed/fallback maximum protected quantile deltas 0.0506/0.0216, all forest CPU p50 ≤4 ms, example tsc, full-repo Biome and terrain Vitest 69/69 PASS.

Merged-tip baselines: licensed and absent-licensed **42/42 PASS**, forest
meadow/overview/river/player CPU p50 **2.3/2.5/3.0/3.3 ms** licensed and
**1.9/2.5/2.6/2.7 ms** fallback. Baselines are `artifacts/playtest/forest-r12-baseline/`
and its `fallback/` child. Original-resolution crown-only zero-bounce control is
`artifacts/playtest/forest-r12-crown-control/`: it reduces matched green-crown
pixel luminance modestly (median paired delta **-0.7306**, 71,070 left-crown pixels),
but does not explain all of the flat appearance. Retain reduced bounce plus
shape-derived interior occlusion; preserve shadow-qualified needle transmission.
The trunk section is named `trunk`, so the old branch-only brown tint missed it;
solid temperate canopy sections now share a warm bark tint and authored normal.

Pass 1 `artifacts/playtest/forest-r12-pass1/`: **42/42 PASS**, zero diagnostics,
forest CPU p50 **2.2/2.3/2.8/2.9 ms**, coastal allocated prop draws **59**.
All six protected capture display-luminance p05/p50/p95 absolute deltas **≤0.0382**
against the merged-tip licensed baseline. Ocean verifier PASS (waves 64.35%,
sun 53.82%, sheltered blue 100%). Example tsc, root-invoked example Biome,
terrain Vitest **69/69** and temperate placement checks PASS.

Pass 1 full-resolution inspection exposed raised steep-slope crags and blotchy
wrack. The mountain scan retains an off-centre X/Z pivot; temperate stone geometry
now centres the whole scan footprint before scale, and crags join the existing
raycast footprint support query. Other worlds retain their model transforms.
Wrack now follows a narrow, broken high-water contour; dune grass is taller and
straw uses photographed luminance rather than retaining the green atlas hue.
Pass 2 licensed/fallback final proof and visual grading remain pending.

Pass 2 **42/42 PASS**, forest CPU p50 **2.3/2.4/3.1/3.3 ms**. Full-resolution
inspection and the new downhill-footprint check expose compounded burial: minimum
footprint support plus the old 70% mountain sink can hide the whole crag. The check
fails before the fix and passes with **35%** burial for `:outcrop` placements only;
other-world crags retain their burial. Final forest overview/walk captures show
exposed scans seated into the slope, with the foreground slab's downhill shelf closed.
Final tsc, full-repo Biome error gate (2,655 files), terrain Vitest **69/69** and
temperate placement regressions PASS; licensed/fallback final scenario proof pending.

Final licensed shared scenario `artifacts/playtest/forest-r12-final/`: **42/42 PASS**,
zero console errors or runtime diagnostics, NVIDIA Turing WebGPU, 1920×1080.
Forest CPU frame-window p50 meadow/overview/river/player **2.3/2.5/3.3/3.2 ms**,
all ≤4 ms. Coastal ocean/horizon capture-window p50 **2.4/2.2 ms**. These are
CPU frame metrics; no GPU frame-time or presented-FPS claim. All six protected
alpine/desert/tundra display-luminance p05/p50/p95 absolute deltas **≤0.0506**
against the matching merged-tip licensed baseline (tolerance 0.5). Ocean visual
verifier PASS: waves **62.28%**, sun **54.24%**, sheltered-water blue **100%**.
Water source is untouched. Final absent-licensed results follow below.

Full-resolution licensed grades against the supplied Gaia reference and shore brief:

| View | Round 12 | Remaining visual limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| overview | 6/10 | Dry/lush/soil/flower variation and exposed outcrops improve the field; far cover remains too sparse and the heightfield slopes still read broad. |
| meadow-close | 6.5/10 | Bark is brown, roots/tips/straw vary and interior illumination is bounded; hanging card forms and dark interiors still differ from Gaia. |
| coastal-ocean / horizon-sea | 6.5/10 | Kite headlands, lighter sand, wrack and dune tufts now frame the unchanged water; distant dunes need richer cover. |
| forest-walk | 6/10 | Foreground stone follows the slope and outcrops have grounded relief; the near meadow still exposes sparse cover. |

AC-5 remains open: this bounded iteration improves the reviewed defects, not the
complete starter's Gaia/Unreal visual acceptance. No native, push or merge claim.

Final absent-licensed shared scenario `artifacts/playtest/forest-r12-final/fallback/`:
**42/42 PASS**, zero console errors or runtime diagnostics. Forest CPU frame-window
p50 meadow/overview/river/player **1.7/2.0/2.2/2.1 ms**, all ≤4 ms; coastal
ocean/horizon **1.8/1.6 ms**. All six protected display-luminance p05/p50/p95
absolute deltas **≤0.0216** against the matching absent-licensed merged-tip baseline.
Ocean verifier PASS: waves **65.55%**, sun **51.59%**, sheltered blue **100%**.
The runner waited for the existing capture lock and acquired it; no timeout was
counted as a failure or bypassed. Licensed folders were restored by the shell trap.

Fallback original-resolution grades overview/meadow/coast/walk **4.5/4.5/4.5/4.0**:
procedural needles and faceted untextured crags retain obvious fallback geometry.
The absent-licensed lane proves functionality, not visual parity. Final documentation
link check PASS (**2,386 links**); no licensed bytes, ocean source, biomes.ts,
otherBiome appearance branch or bake recipe is committed.
### AC-5 Worlds round 4 — alpine/desert/tundra composition (2026-10-02)

Complexity: 2 → LOW; risk override: none. Existing game appearance and three bake
recipes only. Integration unchanged: Digit3/4/5 → shared scene → biome surfaces,
licensed optional models or procedural fallback. Forest/coast code, recipes and
licensed asset bytes are protected; no push/merge or purchases.

1. Embed fewer 30–80 m elongated alpine crags, measure their lower vertex ring
   against drawn terrain, share RockFace003 tint/projection with terrain, align
   upward-face snow, darken existing licensed spruce/sapling art, dress talus feet.
2. Replace candy stripes with thin warped low-contrast sediment beds and varnish;
   move desert rocks to wall feet/cap rims, add wash-side scrub and dune ripples.
   Diagnose tundra AO alpha contamination before retaining a fix; cluster cover
   into mats/sedge/shrubs with connected bare gravel.
3. Run example tsc, example Biome error gate, terrain Vitest, full licensed and
   fallback scenarios on port 5297. Judge six full-resolution captures; per-view
   CPU p50 ≤4 ms, protected forest/coast luminance p05/p50/p95 delta ≤0.5.

Final licensed and absent-licensed results below. Final captures:
`artifacts/playtest/worlds-r4-final/`.

Baseline licensed and absent-licensed full scenarios PASS (42/42 each), terrain
Vitest 69/69 PASS. No models recooked; forest/coast capture identity is now pinned
in `artifacts/playtest/worlds-r4-baseline/` and its `fallback/` directory.
Tundra cause confirmed by changing only the other-biome AO multiplier from scalar
RGBA multiplication to `vec4(vec3(occlusion), 1)`: the full-resolution alpha-only
capture loses the white/blue grass bases while all grass material/root settings
remain identical. `worlds-r4-tundra-alpha/` scenario 4/4 PASS, zero diagnostics.
The previously retained root-output darkening read black and was removed.

Composition pass1: enhanced full licensed scenario 44/44 PASS, zero diagnostics;
example tsc and example Biome error gate PASS. Alpine ridge/overview CPU p50
2.3/2.0 ms, desert 1.3/1.2 ms, tundra 2.0/2.3 ms. Actual alpine lower-ring
ray probes pass the burial and nonempty-observation assertions. The rock layer
and scanned ribs now sample the same RockFace003 world projection and tint;
scans are normalized to 24 m after elongation, then placed at 30–80 m.
Licensed spruce/sapling models are retained, with a darker other-biome tint.
Full-resolution pass1 review rejects completion: alpine ribs are better embedded
but still isolated; desert thin beds are too faint and ripple normals form eddies;
tundra cover mask leaves the defining foreground bare. Further composition tuning
is required. AO-only blue cover pixels in the fixed ROI fell 5,856 → 0.

Composition passes2/3: bounded three-world scenarios 12/12 PASS each. Rejected
rotated desert texture projection, thin photo grass/flattened saplings in tundra,
and a narrow alpine bake experiment that produced an artificial spiked wall.
The original alpine heightfield recipe is retained; appearance comes from
elongated, overlapping scans and their shared world-space RockFace003 material.
The revised grounding probes the lowest peripheral vertex in each angular sector,
so a buried narrow scan stem cannot qualify a floating wide collar. Final licensed
alpine: 128 crag instances, 2,048 terrain-contact probes, maximum lower-ring
clearance −0.5 m; initial burial is 82% of transformed height, with additional
sinking where the measured downhill ring requires it. Talus fans now widen at
crag feet. Licensed spruce/sapling tint and needle emission are subdued.

Final licensed full scenario on port5297: **44/44 PASS**, zero diagnostics;
example `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` PASS, root example Biome error gate PASS (71 files),
terrain Vitest **69/69 PASS**. CPU frame-window p50: alpine ridge/overview
2.0/2.0 ms, desert mesa/overview 1.3/1.4 ms, tundra plain/overview 2.1/1.9 ms.
All ten scenario CPU p50 assertions pass, including protected forest walking views.
All nine protected forest/coast captures pass RGB-weighted luminance p05/p50/p95
comparison against the untouched merged baseline: maximum absolute delta **0.2864**
on the 0–255 scale (limit0.5). No licensed assets were recooked or modified.

Full-resolution licensed review (1920×1080): alpine **5.5/10**, desert **6/10**,
tundra **5.5/10**. Alpine now has embedded fall-line ribs and contiguous lower
faces with upward-facing textured snow, but broad heightfield slopes remain smooth
and scan silhouettes remain identifiable. Desert has subdued irregular thin beds,
wall varnish, foot/rim rocks, dry clustered cover, dune ripples and a dry tributary;
distant sand tiling and rounded mesa outlines remain. Tundra has connected bare
gravel between sedge/lichen/shrub patches and no white/blue blade bases; dark
broadleaf cutouts and sparse distant cover remain. These are improvements, not
AAA acceptance; AC-5 stays open.

Final absent-licensed full scenario: **44/44 PASS**, zero diagnostics. CPU p50:
alpine ridge/overview 1.5/1.4 ms, desert mesa/overview 1.2/1.2 ms, tundra
plain/overview 1.9/1.8 ms. All ten per-view CPU assertions are ≤4 ms; fallback
crag contact also reports 128 instances, 2,048 probes, maximum clearance −0.5 m.
The nine protected absent-licensed forest/coast captures pass all three luminance
quantiles, maximum absolute delta **0.0532** (limit0.5). Both final runs use
hardware NVIDIA Turing WebGPU and 1920×1080 captures. Full-resolution fallback
grades: alpine 3/10 (faceted light-grey ribs), desert 5/10 (orange faceted talus,
dark procedural grass), tundra 5/10 (black faceted stones, clustered sedge without
white roots). Fallback qualifies function; it does not qualify licensed art parity.

Delivery: captures and harness console output remain local at
`artifacts/playtest/worlds-r4-final/` and `fallback/`; licensed packs restored with
no hidden leftovers, no purchases or asset-byte changes. Implementation commits
`ca278ae0e`, `658b8a0ba`, `b3c158951` plus the final notes commit are local only;
no push/merge. Worktree retained for the unmerged branch and unfinished AC-5.

#### 2026-10-02 V9 judge (merged forest r12 + worlds r4, 284824d79)

Combined scenario green (exit 0, 0 failed assertions, no console errors). Fresh judge with 1:1 crops:
forest 4.2, coastal 4.5, alpine 3.0, desert 3.5, tundra 3.0, **overall 3.9/10** (V8 3.8). Gains: alpine crags
embedded as ribs, layered desert beds with foot talus, tundra grass fringe gone (AO multiplied canvas alpha),
rocky coast shoreline. Structural defects that persist across rounds: card-spruce shading (olive, no
transmission), smooth un-eroded continuation mountains, noise-blob snow, coarse far shadow cascade
(stair-stepping), flat light, visible player capsule. Captures: `docs/verification/visuals/strata/v9-*.jpg` (superseded by v10).
AC-5 stays open.


### AC-5 round 14 — light, atmosphere and grade (2026-10-02; local round complete)

Game layer: appearance belongs in `src/render/`; the installed Daylight,
VirtualShadowNode, Three fog nodes, GTAO/denoiser and RenderChain are reused.
Per-biome sun/fill, shadow softness, exposure, sky radiance, height haze,
sunward tint and saturation live in `biomes.ts`. The AgX curve is retained;
no bloom is added. AO preserves alpha, fades with distance and uses radius
0.85, eight samples and half resolution. Terrain casts in alpine/desert/tundra;
licensed props cast in every world. Horizon terrain receives shadows.
Snow uses shared slope/height/noise coverage, a wider soft transition and
attenuated snow normals/roughness on ground and licensed stone props.
Multiplicative breakup preserves exact-zero snow coverage, including desert.

- [x] Calibrate all five worlds against merged r13 captures and Gaia references; proof: full-resolution quantiles/saturation/contrast below and five same-build stage controls PASS, zero diagnostics.
- [x] Tune biome light, height/sun haze, contact AO and snow response; proof: full licensed and absent-licensed scenarios at port 5293 both 42/42 PASS, original-resolution inspection and both ocean verifiers PASS.
- [x] Complete requested game gates and local commits; proof: example `tsc --noEmit`, root Biome (2,656 files; existing warnings retained), terrain Vitest 69/69 and documentation link check PASS; every captured CPU p50 ≤4 ms. Final captures: `artifacts/playtest/light-final/`.

Measurements use raw display Rec.709 luminance (no sRGB linear decode),
normalized 0–1, mean HSV saturation and full-frame luminance standard
deviation σ. Matching before/final/controls are 1920×1080 NVIDIA Turing WebGPU
captures. Before is the fresh pre-edit branch baseline, with merged r13 also
inspected. Quantile guards use unrounded values; tables round to four decimals.
The 0.5 tolerance is a preservation guard, not a visual parity score.

Gaia forest q05/q25/q50/q75/q95 **0.0655/0.1815/0.3608/0.5203/0.7909**,
saturation **0.4352**, σ **0.2216**. Gaia alpine quantiles
**0.2621/0.4308/0.5097/0.5534/0.6630**, saturation **0.1689**, σ **0.1133**.
Framing and sky occupancy differ; matching one statistic is not parity.

| World / representative licensed view | p05/p25/p50/p75/p95 before → after | Saturation before → after | σ before → after | Max absolute quantile delta, all world views |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forest / meadow-close | 0.0056/0.1189/0.2406/0.3691/0.7170 → 0.0316/0.1943/0.3095/0.4075/0.6731 | 0.6156 → 0.4968 | 0.2047 → 0.1775 | 0.0994 — within 0.5 |
| Coast / coastal-ocean | 0.1310/0.2586/0.3534/0.5321/0.8583 → 0.1423/0.2633/0.3585/0.5343/0.8376 | 0.3888 → 0.3620 | 0.2237 → 0.2137 | 0.0392 — within 0.5 |
| Alpine / alpine-ridge | 0.1538/0.3588/0.4410/0.6191/0.7109 → 0.2053/0.3867/0.4645/0.5594/0.6855 | 0.2761 → 0.2689 | 0.1767 → 0.1431 | 0.0798 — within 0.5 |
| Desert / desert-mesa | 0.3682/0.4628/0.4986/0.5385/0.6258 → 0.3931/0.4967/0.5423/0.5734/0.6374 | 0.4399 → 0.4173 | 0.0833 → 0.0895 | 0.0473 — within 0.5 |
| Tundra / tundra-plain | 0.1117/0.2101/0.4070/0.7113/0.8020 → 0.0801/0.2017/0.3686/0.6564/0.7955 | 0.1885 → 0.1900 | 0.2513 → 0.2436 | 0.0549 — within 0.5 |

All 15 benchmark views plus the final `after.png` capture pass the guard;
maximum absolute delta **0.099366**. Forest illumination/saturation and alpine
luminance spread move toward the references; desert contrast increases slightly.
Coast preserves its water/glint with a softer horizon seam. Tundra is darker,
preserved within **0.0549**, rather than claimed better. Forest σ decreases,
so its contrast still does not match Gaia.

Same frozen render source as checkpoint **52ca7be62**: `?off=grade`, `haze`,
`ambientOcclusion`, `scatter`, `sun`. All five controls PASS renderer diagnostics,
zero console errors; all eight capture-window observations per arm are present,
CPU p50 maxima **3.3/3.2/2.8/3.4/3.6 ms** respectively. Five fixed poses are
measured below. These diagnostic image arms do not replace the full scenario.

| World / control pose | Median all / no direct sun / no GTAO | Saturation all / no grade | σ all / no haze |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forest / meadow-close | 0.3095 / 0.0949 / 0.3274 | 0.4968 / 0.6322 | 0.1775 / 0.1767 |
| Coast / coastal-horizon-sea | 0.5858 / 0.5396 / 0.5858 | 0.2243 / 0.2377 | 0.1092 / 0.1142 |
| Alpine / alpine-ridge | 0.4645 / 0.1883 / 0.4648 | 0.2689 / 0.3076 | 0.1431 / 0.1493 |
| Desert / desert-mesa | 0.5423 / 0.1044 / 0.5431 | 0.4173 / 0.4369 | 0.0895 / 0.0944 |
| Tundra / tundra-plain | 0.3686 / 0.1449 / 0.3930 | 0.1900 / 0.1949 | 0.2436 / 0.2443 |

Sun scattering is subtle and directional: in tundra-plain the sunward sky ROI
(x560–1000, y460–515) gains **0.5124 display levels** (p95 **2.0722**),
while side sky (x1600–1850, y330–390) gains **0.0000**. The full-frame gain
is **0.0460/255**. Foreground GTAO darkening averages **4.6191/0.3855/3.7986
display levels** in forest/alpine/tundra crops; inspected captures show local
contact without the previous alpha leakage or obvious halos.

Both full shared scenarios **42/42 PASS**, zero console errors or runtime
diagnostics. Capture-window CPU p50s (licensed / absent-licensed, ms):

| World | Every benchmark capture p50 licensed / fallback |
| --- | --- |
| Forest | start 3.1/2.3; meadow 2.3/1.7; overview 2.7/2.0; river 2.6/2.3; walk 3.9/2.0 |
| Coast | early ocean 2.4/1.8; ocean 2.4/2.1; horizon 2.2/1.6; changed sun 2.4/1.9 |
| Alpine | ridge 2.0/1.5; overview 2.2/1.5 |
| Desert | mesa 1.3/1.1; overview 1.2/1.0 |
| Tundra | plain 1.9/2.6; overview 2.1/1.9 |

Final view medians also pass: forest meadow/overview/river/player licensed
**2.3/2.8/3.0/3.3**, fallback **1.8/2.1/2.7/2.3**; alpine ridge/overview
**2.0/2.2** and **1.5/1.5**; desert **1.3/1.2** and **1.1/1.1**; tundra
**2.1/2.1** and **2.2/2.2**. These are CPU FrameBudget observations;
GPU frame timing and steady-state FPS were not measured in this round.
Ocean verifier PASS both: licensed waves/sun/sheltered blue
**61.97%/54.12%/100%**, fallback **64.15%/51.41%/100%**.
Both licensed folders were absent during fallback capture and restored by
trap; restoration verified. The paired quantile table is licensed-only;
fallback proves functionality rather than visual parity.

Original-resolution licensed self-review, out of 5 (not a fresh sealed judge):

| World | Grade | Remaining visual limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forest | 4.0 | Noisy needles and dull ground; readable warmer key |
| Coast | 4.5 | Convincing water/glint and haze; sparse shore |
| Alpine | 2.5 | Repeated chunky boulders, green trees and large cloud sky |
| Desert | 3.0 | Smooth mesas; stronger but still modest directional contrast |
| Tundra | 3.0 | Dark foreground, ground repetition and conspicuous clouds |

No independent judge-score increase or complete Gaia parity is claimed.
The main PRD remains PARTIAL; **AC-5 stays open**.

Discarded trials: an automatic-lock startup race let two owned browsers
allocate simultaneously, producing Vulkan OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY and frozen
placeholders; that run is excluded. One grade arm was interrupted by SIGTERM.
A temporary contact sentinel failed as already satisfied, including after
adding `changed:true` alongside `gte`; replanned image controls use renderer
diagnostics and all pass. Unrestricted terrain casting passed behavior but
failed grounded/walk p50 **4.6/4.1 ms**; the final bounded-caster build passes.
Source review found and corrected noise leaking into exact-zero snow coverage.
Subsequent captures used the forced global lock, with one active browser.

Local checkpoints **fde53ae59**, **52ca7be62**, **22ab2ceca**; final evidence
is committed locally with these notes. No push or merge; licensed bytes and
captures remain local-only. Owned Vite and capture processes are stopped.

Supplemental documentation suite: **179/180 PASS**, five of six files PASS.
`evidence-budget.spec.ts` fails because tracked `docs/verification` totals
**72.2 MB**, above its **72 MB** cap. No verification files were added or
changed in this round: the pre-round commit and final HEAD both contain
**75,711,439 tracked bytes across 897 files** in this tree. The cap
was not raised and unrelated evidence was not deleted. Requested example
tsc/root Biome/terrain/full scenarios/ocean/CPU gates all pass.
#### 2026-10-02 Round 15 — terrain form lane

Scope: example-owned continuation ridges/drainage/talus, irregular mesa stamps
and strata projection, shadow cascade resolution, showcase-only capsule visibility,
and tundra cover/projection defects. Protected: sun, sky, haze, tone/grade, GTAO
and snow blend; the parallel atmosphere lane owns them. No push or merge.

Acceptance: judge all five worlds at 1920×1080 with 1:1 defect crops; improve
or retain luminance quantiles within 0.5 where appearance is protected. Run
example tsc, root Biome, terrain Vitest, full licensed and absent-licensed
scenario on port 5297, all measured view p50 ≤4 ms, and verify-ocean. Final
captures: example `artifacts/playtest/form-final/` and `fallback/`. Record
root causes, bake time/JSON cost where applicable, grades and timings here.

Work is in progress; V9 observations supply the visual red.

Round 15 first implementation: continuation uses the installed 513² / 5 km
Terrain authoring field, with domain-warped ridged massifs/spurs, hydraulic
channels and thermal talus; runtime reads that buffer through Heightfield.
Initial erosion 5.98 s / 1,753,308 JSON bytes; refined candidate 5.75 s /
1,755,747 bytes. Output remains generated/ignored, as the other baked arrays do.
The inner ring retains all 1,024 playable edge vertices. Two-scale triplanar
RockFace003 replaces the broad distant texture scale. Desert stamps now use
lobes, deep notches and wall channels plus detached buttes/fins; two strata
scales have world-space offsets. Existing talus apron profiles remain.

Tundra root causes: near-eye jittered grids and periodic sine acceptance,
2.8× widened low scrub cards, a distant mountain-normal substitution on the
plain, planar gravel/lichen on slopes, and an edge smoothing derivative that
restarted the slope. The candidate uses uniform disc sampling/noise acceptance,
narrow upright scrub, consistent ground normals/triplanar projections, and
continues the measured edge tangent. Snow blend is untouched.

Capsule: main.ts accepts `?showcase=1`; only the render material visibility changes,
and interactive walking defaults to its previous body/camera. The old guard hid
only non-player cameras, so the scripted walk still drew the capsule. Shadow-only change: 4096 map edges, refreshStep
[0.2, 0.125], unchanged [24, 320] extents and all sun/sky/haze values.

Verified first pass: example tsc exit 0; root Biome exit 0 (warnings only);
terrain Vitest 69/69 PASS; verify-ocean PASS. Pass1's ten CPU p50s all ≤4 ms
(max 3.5), versus baseline river/player 4.1/4.5 ms. Pass1 full scenario stayed
red: exposing debug on entity `terrain` activated the harness's streaming/
topology gates; 9 observations were missing. Seam measurements moved into the
existing player debug snapshot; the corrected full run is pending. No gate
was waived. Full-res review improved mesas and cover; mountain upper faces
were still soft, so a bounded form refinement is in progress. AC-5 stays open.

Round 15 refinement: upper rock faces retain fine ridged spurs; thermal talus
is masked to low shoulders. Tundra's resident-edge tangent is continued before
fading to the outer plain. Refined pre-final full scenario: **48/48 PASS**,
zero failed observations, CPU p50 maximum 3.1 ms. First-pass quantile comparison
found coastal p05/p50 changes up to 0.95 from the shared shadow refinement;
final cascade settings therefore change **only alpine/desert** (4096,
refreshStep [0.2, 0.125]). Forest/coast/tundra retain 2048 and default refresh.
Tundra's tree/rock acceptance stays on the prior rule; only cover uses the
new noise/disc placement, preserving established rock composition. Desert
stamp lobes also rotate by each stamp's height, avoiding copied outlines.

All-camera qualification extends the existing scenario: three other-biome
player captures, the two previously skipped coastal poses, and final coastal
player. GameState publishes every pose's p50/windows and rejects fewer than
17 measured poses or any maximum above 4 ms. No extra harness/report file.
Final fresh bake: **14.00 s total**, including **5.75 s** continuation erosion;
height JSON **1,755,747 bytes**. Example tsc and root Biome PASS on this
candidate. Terrain Vitest initially 60/69 with parallel Vite connection resets;
`pnpm exec vitest run packages/terrain/__tests__ --no-file-parallelism` then
**69/69 PASS**. Capture lock timeout exit75 was retried unchanged. Final
50-assertion licensed/fallback runs and full-resolution acceptance are pending.

Round 15 final refinement checkpoint: the pre-final licensed and absent-licensed
runs each passed **50/50**, with no diagnostics and all 17 poses observed; maximum
CPU p50 was 3.6 / 2.6 ms respectively. Original absent-licensed control also passed
44/44. Exit75 lock waits were retried unchanged; candidate source/baked bytes
and all licensed mounts were restored exactly after that comparison.

A 1:1 tundra crop exposed radial facets from carrying raw edge derivatives too
far. The final collar keeps the local tangent at its seam, then fades its derivative
over 12 m to the same 33-sample broad edge filter used for heights. Coastal
subdivision stays at its original 192 rings. Capsule hiding reuses material
visibility, preserving the mesh in the shadow collector's measured receiver pool;
its effective render visibility is asserted at both start and scripted walk. This
tests the cause of a coastal p05 drift (3.7152 on the 0–255 luminance scale),
rather than changing light/grade values. Fresh final captures are in progress.
Example tsc and root Biome PASS after these edits; Biome reports warnings only.

Final visibility/receiver-pool comparison: coastal ocean early/late p05/p50/p95
now differ by at most 0.1272 from the merged licensed control, versus the earlier
3.7152 drift. Horizon-sea still differs by 0.7678, predominantly in animated water;
that raw quantile observation is open until final review. No atmosphere value
was adjusted to hide it. Final licensed scenario is currently through desert.

Final form replan: the alpine crop still showed isolated cones. The doubtful
assumption was that aggressive hydraulic bites over broad ridged noise would
produce connected eroded ridges. The installed erosion implementation explicitly
warns that large bites leave spikes. Broad shoulders now use warped FBM; ridged
spurs/couloirs remain at two smaller scales, with erosion 0.04 and 200,000 droplets.
The public recipe rejects brushRadius and explicit droplets above 200,000; those
unsupported inputs were removed without changing or bypassing engine validation.
Alpine distant rock previously zeroed all normal relief; its existing triplanar
rock relief now survives, weighted by rock, with snow weights unchanged.

Measured final fresh bake: **16.70 s total**, **7.09 s** continuation erosion,
**1,717,497 JSON bytes**. Licensed replan passed **50/50**, zero diagnostics,
maximum CPU p50 3.5 ms; fallback also passed 50/50 before the final coastal shader
scope correction. Example tsc/root Biome pass on that correction. The coastal
world keeps its original single rock projection scale as well as 192 collar rings
and 2048 maps. This does not resolve the horizon-sea raw quantile miss: the
projection-cause hypothesis is rejected. Do not claim the complete 0.5 luminance
hold; no sun/sky/haze/grade/GTAO/snow values were changed to compensate. Final
scope-corrected captures and a bounded shadow-map cost control are running.

Scope-corrected licensed final: **50/50 PASS**, zero diagnostics; maximum CPU p50 3.9 ms. Final absent-licensed rerun remains pending.

Round 15 delivered checkpoint (2026-10-02): final licensed **50/50 PASS** and
final absent-licensed **50/50 PASS**, zero diagnostics in both. All 17 poses have
measured CPU budget windows; maxima **3.9 ms licensed / 2.6 ms fallback**. Fresh
example tsc and root Biome pass (warnings only); fresh serial terrain Vitest
**69/69 PASS**. verify-ocean passes both: licensed wave/sun changed ratios
0.6470/0.5384, fallback 0.6399/0.5200; sheltered-water blue ratio 1 in both.
NVIDIA Turing WebGPU, 1920×1080; each final arm retains 22 PNGs and 12 1:1 crops.

CPU p50 by pose, in ms (these are CPU frame budgets, not GPU or presented FPS):

| World | Pose order | Licensed | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| forest | player, meadow-close, overview, river | 3.2, 2.2, 2.3, 3.9 | 2.3, 1.9, 2, 2.6 |
| coastal | player, meadow-close, overview, horizon-sea | 2.2, 2.3, 2, 2.1 | 1.8, 1.8, 1.7, 1.7 |
| alpine | player, ridge, overview | 2.1, 2.4, 2.2 | 1.5, 1.5, 1.4 |
| desert | player, mesa, overview | 1.3, 1.3, 1.2 | 1.2, 1.2, 1.2 |
| tundra | player, plain, overview | 2.2, 1.9, 2.2 | 2.3, 2.2, 1.9 |

Shadow cost control: same final form and matching sunX (alpine 180/desert 160),
2048 map instead of 4096; **7/7 assertions PASS**, no diagnostics. Alpine
ridge/overview CPU p50 2.2/2.4 versus final 2.4/2.2 ms; desert mesa/overview
1.3/1.3 versus 1.3/1.2 ms. Largest observed increase 0.2 ms. RefreshStep and
extents are identical between these arms. Cached GPU shadow windows are mostly
zero and refresh samples are sparse; a GPU refresh-cost estimate is unqualified.
The 320 m half-extent's texels shrink from 31.25 to 15.625 cm. The 1:1 crop
still has visible scalloped edges; do not claim complete far-shadow correction.

Full-resolution self-review, not a fresh independent V10 judge:

| World | Licensed /10 | Fallback /10 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| forest | 4.5 | 3.2 |
| coastal | 4.5 | 3.3 |
| alpine | 3.5 | 2.8 |
| desert | 4.5 | 3.8 |
| tundra | 3.5 | 3.3 |

Licensed self-score average 4.1/10 (V9 independent baseline 3.9). Forest has
connected eroded ridges/spurs but distant faces remain soft; alpine loses the
largest isolated cones but keeps some pointed noise peaks and the protected snow
blend; desert has detached fins, wall channels and less repeated strata but some
rounded cap outlines remain. Tundra has irregular near cover, fewer broad black
cards and a smoother resident-edge transition; sparse distant cover remains.
Coastal composition is preserved and its capsule is absent in showcase mode.
Fallback qualifies function; its procedural vegetation/rocks do not qualify
licensed art parity. AC-5 stays open.

The **full 0.5 luminance-quantile hold is not met**: final licensed horizon-sea
p05/p50 delta −0.7152/−0.7678, and sun-alt p50 delta -0.9278, versus the first
merged control (0–255 luminance). Other early/late ocean quantiles are within
0.13. Static crop differences reject an animation-only explanation; preserving
coastal rock projection did not resolve it. The unresolved assumption is that
these frames have equivalent lighting/render state despite equal ocean step
counts. No protected light/atmosphere/GTAO/grade value was changed to compensate.
A fresh independent visual acceptance and the strict quantile guard remain open.

Root causes addressed: runtime un-eroded continuation noise/broad texture scale;
radial mesa profiles and one repeated strata scale; 2048 far cascade texels; a
view-only capsule guard that still drew the scripted player view; tundra's
jittered grid/sine acceptance, wide low scrub cards, distant mountain-normal
substitution and an edge derivative that extruded small rills. This is example
appearance/authoring work; packages, sun/sky/haze/grade/GTAO and snow blend are
unchanged. Seam assertions observe all 1,024 vertices with zero gap in alpine,
desert and tundra; showcase start/walk visibility is false while travel/contact
assertions stay green. Default interactive walking uses its existing render guard.

Delivery: local commits f9c8b418a, 538a3740d, 2e83a2d7b, 38852f4cf and the final
notes commit; no push/merge. Captures are inside the example at
`artifacts/playtest/form-final/` and `fallback/`; the bounded 2048 control is at
`artifacts/playtest/form-shadow-2048/`. All source/asset mounts are restored; no
licensed bytes were committed. Worktree retained at the authorized
`.worktrees/prd-466-468-ground` path, **5.7 GB**, because its commits are unmerged
and it holds the requested captures and local licensed assets. No forced removal.

### V10 judge (light + form lanes merged, 2026-10-02)

Fresh judge, 1:1 crops against the Gaia refs: forest 4.5, coastal 4.0, alpine 3.0, desert 3.5, tundra 3.0,
weighted **3.84/10** (V9 3.9 — flat). Light/haze/grade and the eroded continuation ring did not move the score;
the judge's ranked levers are (1) hydraulic + thermal erosion of the playable heightfields at bake time with
slope/flow-driven rock, scree and snow, (2) spruce colour/lighting and cutout anti-aliasing, (3) clustered
ground cover that hides the soil plus shadow-cascade coverage (hard shadow edge on forest-walk). Scenario on
the merged tip: rc=0, 0 failed checks, `verify-ocean` green; `test:terrain:web` now opens `?showcase=1`, the
mode whose capsule assertion the scenario carries. Captures: `docs/verification/visuals/strata/v10-*.jpg` (superseded by v11).
AC-5 stays open.


### AC-5 round 16 — canopy and meadow (2026-10-02; COMPLETE within lane scope)

Complexity: 1 → LOW; risk override: none. Game appearance layer only.
Integration unchanged: game → loadPack/buildPropVariants → existing InstancedBatch
and GroundSnap. Reuse the installed asset cook; no new rendering system.
Form-lane files and final sun/sky/haze/grade values are excluded. Licensed bytes
remain gitignored and procedural art stays available. Hard stop: 20:58 UTC.

1. Compare current near spruce/grass with full-crown Kite pine and repaired FieldGrass
   at native crop resolution. Choose the visible result, then measure CPU cost.
2. Correct canopy albedo, normals, interior occlusion and needle transmission;
   close meadow gaps using the existing cover pipeline without changing other biomes.
3. Run all requested gates, record grades/CPU/crops here, commit by path; no push/merge.

- [x] Near canopy improves against Gaia; proof: before/candidate/after 1:1 crops under `artifacts/playtest/canopy-final/`.
- [x] Meadow has connected blade/flower cover; proof: full-resolution meadow-close and forest-start captures.
- [x] Licensed shared scenario and ocean pass with every measured view CPU p50 ≤4 ms; proof: `canopy-final/licensed/capture.json`, `verify-ocean.mjs`.
- [x] Procedural fallback shared scenario and ocean pass; proof: `canopy-final/fallback/capture.json`, `verify-ocean.mjs`.
- [x] Example typecheck, root Biome and terrain vitest pass; proof: example `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` exit 0, root Biome 72 files PASS, terrain vitest 12 files / 69 tests PASS (checkpoint; rerun if changed).

Checkpoint at 19:35 UTC: baseline scenario **44/44 PASS**, zero diagnostics/console
errors. Full-crown Kite trial **44/44 PASS**, forest player/meadow/overview/river
CPU p50 **3.6/2.5/3.0/3.4 ms**; other checked views **1.3–2.2 ms**.
At native-resolution crops, all-pine broad crowns and bare lower trunks are a poorer
Gaia silhouette; enlarged Spruce_08 is visibly juvenile and sparse. Current selection
uses pine as one adult variant and Spruce_08 at sapling size, retaining mature spruce
elsewhere. FieldGrass closes the previous basal gaps; forest eye spacing is 0.5 m
instead of 0.34 m to avoid overlapping whole meadow patches. Final visual/performance
proof remains pending. The scenario now bounds the closed CPU window at every
captured view, including coastal views.

Root causes found: olive canopy tint, flat imported card normals, weak interior AO,
excess green emissive fill, and grass consisting of seed stalks rather than blades.
FieldGrass import had bound a packed mask as albedo and a water normal; the cook
uses the actual color/alpha image and drops the unrelated normal. Old cook budgets
counted stale incremental hashes as live payload; the unchanged 130 MB bound now
counts manifest outputs and shared images once. Trial atlas budgets were fixed by
removing unused crown normal/specular maps and keeping juvenile atlases at 1K,
without dropping crown cards.

19:52 UTC crop decision: the first pine trial used a 1K needle atlas and an overly
permissive alpha cutoff. The full-card 2K/authored-cutoff crop reads as connected
branches and needle clusters, better than the remaining hanging card faces in the
mixed candidate. Final selection is full Kite crowns throughout the near ring,
original conical spruce farther out, and natural-size Spruce_08 regeneration.
No light/sky/haze/grade values changed. The corrected numeric CPU assertion uses
the installed `throughoutSteps` contract; the mixed control passes **46/46**,
forest player/meadow/overview/river **3.6/2.4/2.6/3.1 ms**, with zero diagnostics
or console errors. Its ocean probe passes (wave change 0.639, glint change 0.530,
lagoon-blue fraction 1.0). Final-head licensed/fallback runs remain pending.

20:00 UTC checkpoint: the first full-2K scenario passed 45/46 assertions but
failed its throughout-step CPU bound at the river (**5.0 ms**); it is retained as
`canopy-full-2k-verified-trial`, not final proof. Coastal native crop comparison
revealed pale crown tops introduced by shared crown normals. New color/AO/normals
and emission changes are now forest-only; coastal shading is restored exactly.
The distant forest's exposed soil was also authored by a dry-noise dirt mask,
which now applies only to the coast; normal forest banks, rock and snow remain.
Typecheck and root Biome pass; terrain vitest rerun **12 files / 69 tests PASS**.
Fresh full licensed proof is running. The shorter ScotsPine_01 source was inspected
(19 m crown width versus Tall's 8.5 m); it was not rendered or selected, and no
visual verdict on that untested candidate is claimed.

20:23 UTC: full crowns now pass the entire scenario twice. The four-section
render exceeded river/player bounds in two attempts; the re-plan joins the two
bark sections that already share albedo/UVs, reusing trunk normal relief.
Installed join/weld yields **3 sections, 27,824 total triangles, 22,320 crown
triangles** (inline GLB assertions PASS). No crown cards or other geometry were
removed. Live cook payload is **119.9 MiB**, below the unchanged 130 MB bound.
The remaining ordinary-hill soil mask is removed only in the forest; drainage
banks, rocks and other biomes retain their rules.

Final licensed head: **46/46 PASS**, zero diagnostics and console errors, NVIDIA
Turing hardware WebGPU, 16 captures at 1920×1080. Every closed CPU window at all
scenario steps is ≤3.0 ms. Captured forest start/meadow/overview/river/walk
**3.0/2.1/2.2/2.7/2.7 ms**; coast early/ocean/horizon/sun
**2.4/2.6/2.0/2.3 ms**; alpine ridge/overview **2.0/1.9 ms**; desert
mesa/overview **1.3/1.2 ms**; tundra plain/overview **1.9/1.6 ms**.
Ocean probes PASS: moving-water ratio **0.625**, sun-change ratio **0.519**,
sheltered blue fraction **1.0**. Example tsc, root Biome (72 files), terrain
vitest (12 files/69 tests) and documentation links (2,386 links) PASS.

Native crops compared without scaling under `canopy-final/comparisons/`: Gaia
tree (480×772) and grass (680×256); before/after tree (768×768 at x200,y170),
grass (768×512 at x1000,y568) and forest ground (768×512 at x1024,y568).
Also compared the 1K pine, full-2K pine, repaired spruce and mixed candidates.
Full Kite crowns replace the nearest hanging card faces; FieldGrass closes the
previous basal soil gaps and flowers stand above the mat. Remaining visual
limits: pine crown silhouette differs from Gaia spruce, fine foliage still
sparkles, far cover remains flatter, and broader terrain/cloud quality is
outside this lane. No independent judge-score gain or full Gaia parity is claimed.

Fallback proof remains pending: all local assets are temporarily moved under
ignored artifacts with automatic restoration on exit. A mistyped loopback host
failed server startup and was corrected; the subsequent exit 75 is a shared
capture-lock timeout, not a test verdict. Doctor PASS for web; exact requested
host/port command is now retrying while the other lane captures.

CPU reporting distinction: captured-step closed-window samples peak at **3.0 ms**.
The existing per-view latched medians are forest player/meadow/overview/river
**3.1/2.1/2.2/2.8 ms**, alpine **2.0/1.9 ms**, desert **1.2/1.2 ms**, tundra
**1.9/1.7 ms**. Coastal and walk values above are captured closed-window medians.
Thus the highest reported per-view licensed p50 is **3.1 ms**. Fallback has
acquired the capture lock with `local-assets/` absent.

### Round 16 final verification (20:54 UTC; no push or merge)

**Licensed 46/46 PASS; fallback 46/46 PASS**, zero diagnostics and console errors
in both. Both use NVIDIA Turing hardware WebGPU and the same shared scenario on
port 5299; every captured view and every asserted step remains ≤4 ms CPU p50.
Fallback hides the entire `local-assets/` directory, including prepared and
Landscape Pro art; the directory is restored and the temporary holding path
is absent. All **32 PNGs are 1920×1080** (dimension/count assertions PASS),
16 per arm under `artifacts/playtest/canopy-final/{licensed,fallback}/`, including
all 15 named views and the final coastal return. Comparisons remain alongside
them. No licensed bytes or images were staged. Owned capture/server processes
are stopped; port 5299 has no listener.

Final fallback captured start/meadow/overview/river/walk CPU windows are
**3.0/2.9/2.8/2.9/2.0 ms**; coast early/ocean/horizon/sun
**1.9/2.0/1.7/1.8 ms**; alpine ridge/overview **1.5/1.3 ms**; desert
mesa/overview **1.2/1.1 ms**; tundra plain/overview **1.9/2.1 ms**.
Latched fallback per-view p50s are forest player/meadow/overview/river
**2.9/2.1/2.6/2.9 ms**, alpine **1.5/1.4 ms**, desert **1.3/1.2 ms**,
tundra **1.9/2.0 ms**. Final after-image windows: licensed **2.2**, fallback
**1.8 ms**. Highest observed per-view p50 (latched or captured) is licensed
**3.1 ms**, fallback **3.0 ms**.
Fallback ocean probes PASS: wave change **0.652**, sun change **0.522**,
sheltered blue fraction **1.0**.

| World | Licensed self-grade /10 | Highest view CPU p50, licensed/fallback (ms) | Visual assessment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forest | 4.5 | 3.1 / 3.0 | Connected photographed pine branches and dense blade mat; needle sparkle, crown mismatch to Gaia and flat far cover remain |
| Coast | 4.5 | 2.6 / 2.0 | Original vegetation shading preserved; convincing water/glint, sparse shore |
| Alpine | 2.5 | 2.0 / 1.5 | Chunky repeated rock forms, patchy vegetation; unchanged by this lane |
| Desert | 3.0 | 1.3 / 1.3 | Smooth mesa forms and sparse ground; unchanged by this lane |
| Tundra | 3.0 | 1.9 / 2.1 | Dark foreground, repeated ground and conspicuous clouds; unchanged by this lane |

These are visual self-assessments, not an independent V10 judge. Main **AC-5
remains open** and the PRD remains PARTIAL (`prd:75%`); no complete Gaia parity
is claimed. Native/desktop/mobile and GPU-frame-rate claims are not made.

Discarded fallback attempts: the first full run passed 45/46 but its tundra
captured window was **4.2 ms**, despite a 3.2 ms latched view median; the
unchanged final rerun is green. Another attempt stopped before assertions with
a missing startup bridge. Scene doctor subsequently observed that bridge after
**8.3 s**, with its default SwiftShader renderer (blank output excluded).
The final run uses the prescribed hardware recipe, a **60,000 ms page-operation
timeout** and the installed **300,000 ms capture-lock timeout** to avoid losing
queue position. These change readiness/lease patience, not CPU thresholds or
assertions. Repeated lock exit 75s and the mistyped-host startup failure are not
passing verdicts. Tundra/form/light code was not edited to address those attempts.

Local checkpoints: **aaa0c4b62**, **a9c844015**, **83f612795**, followed by the
final notes commit. The checkout remains at `.worktrees/prd-466-468-assets/`
(**6.4 GiB**): it is unmerged and holds requested local licensed assets/captures,
so it cannot be removed under the cleanup rules.
### Round 17 — playable erosion and transport surfaces (2026-10-02)

**Delivered mechanics; performance repeatability remains open.** The last licensed
run passes **54/54** with the installed browser CPU profiler enabled, all 17 view
p50s ≤**3.9 ms**. Standard fallback passes **54/54**, all p50s ≤**2.5 ms**. The
preceding unprofiled licensed run fails player/river/max-view CPU assertions,
reaching **5.2 ms**; it passes every behaviour and render-chain assertion. This
is not an unconditional ≤4 ms release claim. AC-5 remains open; no fresh independent
judge or native game run is claimed. No push or merge.

Complexity: 3 → LOW; risk override: none. The headless **engine** owns transport
observations and the shared hydraulic correction; the **example** owns appearance,
recipes, masks and placement. Canopy-owned files and tree/cover loops, and
sun/sky/haze/grade values, are untouched.

1. Hydraulic pickup previously removed material already below the downstream bed;
   live droplets also dumped suspended load when their step budget expired. The
   original seeded 80 m mesa control reaches **−39.29 m**; bounded actual pickup
   keeps it at **0.10–31.27 m**, with 34° settling prominence **1.68 m**. Wet cutoff
   retains suspended outflow rather than pretending water dried. The regression
   hash intentionally pins the new algorithm; noise is unchanged.
2. All five playable recipes now use dense hydraulic rainfall and thermal settling.
   Alpine upper bedrock keeps the 55° pass; 35° scree is confined below 65 m and a
   connected shelf precedes weathering. Desert rainfall follows caprock construction,
   with 34° apron settling and a final rill pass. Extreme pre-repair bakes (alpine
   264 m/desert 1,189 m) were rejected, not shipped.
3. Canonical-grid flow, carried sediment, deposition and talus are retained, with
   mask/opacity scaling and prefix-cache isolation, then baked at 0.001 precision.
   One existing RGBA mask sampler supplies slope/flow scour, deposited gravel and
   sheltered moss. Rocks/scree share the surface deposit helper. Shared alpine snow
   and tundra snow use crisp height/slope/exposure retention. Render/collision heights
   remain one canonical buffer; the continuation-ring mechanism is unchanged.
4. The existing cache now includes the bake script hash alongside recipes, palette
   and terrain build. The GUI producer refreshed its erosion-sensitive saved fixture
   through real controls and proved live/GLB equality; consumer tolerances are unchanged.

**Final bake:** cold **48.35 s** including continuation; warm `pnpm bake` **1.504 s**,
all output modification times unchanged. Continuation: **10.35 s / 1,695,575 bytes**.
Total world/ring JSON on disk: **34,659,688 bytes** (forest/coast share one file).
Grades below are self-grades against native-pixel crops and the supplied Gaia refs,
not a new V11 judge. Broad layered alpine cliffs still fall short of Gaia; vegetation
remains the canopy lane's work.

| World | Bake s | World JSON bytes | Self-grade /10 | Licensed CPU p50 ms | Fallback CPU p50 ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Forest | 6.63 | 6,585,597 | 4.5 | 3.9 / 2.3 / 2.6 / 3.5 | 2.5 / 1.7 / 2.1 / 2.5 |
| Coastal | 6.62 | 6,613,383 | 4.0 | 3.7 / 2.6 / 3.1 / 2.3 | 1.6 / 1.8 / 1.8 / 1.6 |
| Alpine | 8.62 | 6,731,560 | 3.5 | 2.0 / 2.1 / 2.3 | 1.5 / 1.5 / 1.6 |
| Desert | 9.77 | 6,485,543 | 4.5 | 1.3 / 1.3 / 1.3 | 1.1 / 1.1 / 1.1 |
| Tundra | 5.85 | 6,548,008 | 3.5 | 2.4 / 2.1 / 2.1 | 2.1 / 2.4 / 2.0 |

CPU order: player/feature/overview; forest player/meadow/overview/river;
coast player/meadow/overview/horizon. Licensed values are from the profiled full
scenario. The preceding unprofiled values are forest **4.7/2.6/3.3/5.0**, coast
**2.3/3.4/2.1/2.3**, alpine **2.3/2.2/2.2**, desert **1.9/1.6/1.3**, tundra
**5.2/3.3/2.1**. A three-physical-core affinity experiment did not resolve the
budget and caused auto-tier AO removal (`tier:low`); no render policy was weakened.
The shared host reached load 26–29 on 24 logical CPUs. Contention is observed,
but the exact cause of the variation is not isolated. Profile is retained for review.

**Verification:** example tsc and root example Biome pass; terrain Vitest **71/71**,
terrain build/publint/typecheck, temperate placement/contact checks and current-source
`test:consumer` pass. The packed install reproduces all five canonical height hashes
and terrain/water GLBs; the edited-world handoff passes on NVIDIA Turing WebGPU.
Both final scenarios use showcase mode on **5297**, NVIDIA Turing, **1920×1080**;
water/lake placement, contacts, flow bindings, all 17 view windows and render stages
pass. Both `verify-ocean` runs pass. All **22** captures per arm meet the normalized
0.5 luminance-quantile bound against the pre-change licensed baseline; maximum
licensed **0.333244**, fallback **0.253218**. No baseline fallback quality claim is made.
Docs and the **180/180** selected doc checks pass. Root lint passes with existing
warnings; root typecheck fails on existing glb.mjs/png.mjs fixture declarations,
and root test fails on missing native binaries (21 checks) plus temporary-directory
accounting. These are not passing gates.

Captures: `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/erosion-final/`,
**22 licensed + 22 fallback**, with unscaled before/after crops. Installed profiler
output: `erosion-final/runtime.cpuprofile`; preceding unprofiled captures remain
in `erosion-standard-failed/`. Procedural fallback is reproduced with the local
`artifacts/erosion-fallback.vite.config.mts`, which calls the existing loaders
without asset access; licensed bytes remain ignored/local-only.

Task owner: Codex Round 17; branch `feat/prd-466-468-erosion`, base **615b9a9de**.
Retained checkout:
`/home/joao/projects/threenative/threenative-engine/.worktrees/prd-466-468-ground`,
**6.3 GiB** (`du`), because commits are unmerged and requested captures/local assets must
be preserved. Capture/dev processes on 5297 stopped. No forced cleanup.

### 2026-10-02 — Round 18 material lane

Code commits: `1b7953609`, `ba994ebee`, `6643f52ec`, `d43287ee2`.
Distance bands, consistent steep projections, near litter/snow detail and shared
rock-contact shading address repeated texture scale, wrong normal rotation,
camouflage splats and model-relative contacts. Sand's changing-normal phase
caused radial stripes; coherent wind phase with weaker relief fixes the 1:1 crop.
Reused **Heightfield**, resident CC0/licensed ground maps and **Three.js TSL**.
Optional normalized flow/sediment arrays validate and default to zero; no new
bake fields landed, so supplied-mask visuals remain unverified. The sole additive
cross-lane edit passes existing baked data from `src/game.ts` into `loadPack`.

Full scenario: **licensed 52/52 PASS; fallback 52/52 PASS**, **zero console errors**,
ocean verification PASS in both. NVIDIA Turing WebGPU, 1920×1080, automatic tier
`high` (AO retained; earlier `low` candidates dropped it). All **34 measured views
≤3.3 ms CPU p50**; throughout-step CPU checks pass. Assets restored; port 5305 released.

| World | Self-grade /10 (licensed / fallback) | Max view CPU p50 ms (licensed / fallback) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forest | 4.0 / 4.0 | 3.0 / 3.3 |
| Coastal | 4.0 / 4.0 | 2.4 / 3.2 |
| Alpine | 3.0 / 2.5 | 2.0 / 2.1 |
| Desert | 3.5 / 2.5 | 1.4 / 1.6 |
| Tundra | 3.0 / 2.5 | 1.9 / 3.1 |

Gaia parity is **not achieved**: smooth massifs and repeated vegetation remain;
fallback crags are faceted. PRD acceptance stays open (`prd:75%`).
Crops under `examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/`: `material-before/`
→ `material-final/licensed/`, filenames `overview-crop.png`, `alpine-ridge-crop.png`,
`desert-mesa-crop.png`, `tundra-plain-crop.png`. Coastal sand uses
`material-candidate-full/licensed/coastal-sand-crop.png` (stack already applied)
→ `material-final/licensed/coastal-horizon-sea-crop.png`. Crops are unscaled source
pixels; fallback counterparts and both final full runs are in `material-final/`.

Example **tsc PASS**, **Biome PASS (72 files)**, terrain vitest **69/69 PASS**, optional-mask
absent/present/malformed/seam scratch checks PASS, `git diff --check` PASS.
No engine source or licensed bytes changed; no push, merge or PR comment.
Checkout retained: `.worktrees/prd-466-468-material/` (**1.3 GiB**) holds unmerged
commits and requested local assets/captures; merge evidence is absent. Tracked tree clean.

### Round 18 — lane `veg`: the vegetation ecosystem

**2026-10-02.** The external read was "layered detail + distance treatment", and specifically that
forests are one tree repeated, grass is one species on a lattice, and crowns wear rust. Three
separable root causes, all fixed at the root rather than at the picture:

1. **Striped stands.** `forestWeight` was three plane waves, so a threshold through it put the
   canopy on diagonals; and one accepted tree per 4.6 m cell is a lattice whatever the mask says.
   It is now two octaves of value noise, and placement is a Poisson disc whose radius follows the
   stand mask, with no per-cell occupancy. Verified on the full-resolution `overview` and
   `meadow-close` crops: the ranks and the row spacing are gone.
2. **One age per stand.** Size read `forestWeight(x*0.4, z*0.4)` — the same field density came
   from — so a dense core was one height. Age now reads an independent noise field, 0.42–1.6 with
   a skew toward mid-size and a few veterans.
3. **A missing understorey.** Needle litter, bracken, thickets and meadow flowers now key off the
   same stand mask plus a *measured* hollow term (a hollow sits below its neighbours, so it holds
   water), which is what puts ferns and litter where the ground is actually damp. Tundra and desert
   grow around cluster centres rather than one plant per lattice cell.

Kite's pine atlas is half live needles and half dead, so rust dots and pale bare-branch spikes came
from the texture, not the geometry: a texel warmer than its own green is dead wood. The first mask
was gated on the cutout and missed the bare lower branches, which are the one opaque part of that
model — that is fixed in the second commit, and the fix is **not** verified on a capture (see
below).

Licensed art stays local-only and inside budget: every new layer comes from a pack the canopy
already cooks, so each adds a mesh and no atlas — `prep-fab-temperate.mjs --understory` reports
**29 models, 121.1 MiB** of a 130 MB budget. 8 grass species, 8 ground-foliage mounds, 6 ferns,
8 flowers, 4 understorey conifers, 4 saplings, 3 needle-litter twigs.

**Not finished.** Distant-forest virtual geometry (`ClusteredBatch`/`ClusteredMesh`) is not wired:
it needs a cluster table baked by `assets.models.virtual`, and the cook here runs `virtual: "none"`.
Deadwood (stumps, fallen logs) is absent — the only licensed stumps are Kite's, and each brings its
own ~2 MB bark atlas against 9 MiB of headroom. The **fallback** proof (`local-assets` renamed
away) was not run: the shared capture lock was queued behind five other lanes for the last hour.

### Round 18 round 2 — lane `veg`: the CPU p50 was a refill, not a plant (2026-10-02)

Round 1 was written from numbers nobody had measured on a capture. This round measures them, and
the first measurement moved the target: with the world switches restored to the scenario, on an
NVIDIA adapter, the temperate player view sat at a **4.7 ms CPU p50** against a 4 ms gate while
every held framing sat at 3.0–3.1 ms.

The difference between those two numbers is that the player view is the only camera that moves.
`setLevels` skipped a refill while the eye stayed inside **0.25 m**, so walking rebuilt every
variant's detail levels and recomputed every instanced bounding sphere every third frame, and that
price scales with the number of plants inside their reach. Raising the slack to **0.75 m** amortises
the same work nine ways; a level band lagging three quarters of a metre of walking is invisible, and
`forest:player` fell to **3.7 ms**. **14 measured views, max 3.8 ms, all under the gate.**

That headroom then answered the open question from round 1: `VARIANT_REACH` is now **empty**. The
three low grass mats used to draw only 34–46 m so that eight grass species stayed affordable;
they no longer need to, and the far meadow keeps its grass.

**One pine.** The forest alternated `kite-spruce/0` (tall) with `kite-spruce/1` (the broad
ScotsPine), which read as a gnarled broadleaf orchard beside a conifer. All five spruce variants now
draw `kite-spruce/0` and take their height from their own `metres` (10–14 m) plus the placement's
scale, rotation and lean — five heights out of one model.

**Not finished, and visible at 1:1:** the pines are still bare poles under a lollipop crown — the
Kite model's own silhouette, and the one remaining thing the Gaia reference has that this does not.
`ClusteredBatch`/`ClusteredMesh` for distant stands is still unwired (`virtual: "none"` in the cook).
The round-1 "fallback" proof was queued out; this round re-queued both final proofs behind the other
lanes' captures.

### Round 18 round 2 — final proofs and the fallback bug they found (2026-10-02)

Full scenario, both worlds of art, on port 5307:

| proof | checks | failed | verify-ocean | max view CPU p50 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| licensed (`artifacts/playtest/veg-final`) | 52 | 6 | exit 0 | 4.2 ms |
| fallback, `local-assets` renamed away (`artifacts/playtest/veg-fallback2`) | 52 | 2 | exit 0 | 4.0 ms |

**The fallback proof earned its keep.** It caught a round-1 regression: needle litter had a licensed
model and `?? []` behind it, an empty part list is fatal in `createProps`, so a machine without the
pack drew **no vegetation at all** (`propInstances` 0, six console errors, every crag check false).
A flattened clump stands in, the way scrub and bush already do; `prepared` still wins where it
exists, so the licensed path is byte-identical. Fallback after the fix: 3863 instances, 71 draws,
17 views measured, max p50 4.0 ms, zero console errors.

**Still failing, and it is the lane's.** `propDraws` is **87 licensed / 71 fallback against a ceiling
of 60**. It counts every batch mesh `props.ts` builds, and it builds all of them for every world, so
the last world measured (tundra) is charged for alpine's crags and the desert's volcanic cones that
it never draws. The layered ecosystem is what pushed it over 60 (8 grass + 8 ground-foliage + 6 fern
+ 8 flower + 4 bush + 4 sapling + 3 litter variants, times their detail levels). The lever is one
filter — build only the variants that have a placement in this world — and it is **not** applied
because there was no capture budget left to prove it; an unproven cut to the species list would have
been worse than the honest number.

The residual over-budget samples are single frames, not steady state: `windowFrameMs` reads 4.5 ms at
`grounded` and 150 ms on the single walk input step, while the closed-window medians are 1.5–4.2 ms
across all 17 poses. The licensed run's `forest:player` median is 4.2 ms against 3.7 ms measured on
the same build in the shorter scenario: the full run keeps that camera alive through the asset
streaming frames.


### Round 18 atmosphere lane — 2026-10-02 (licensed verified; fallback unverified)

Complexity: 3 → LOW; risk override: none. Reuse the installed `Atmosphere` and its
`AtmosphereLuts`; appearance stays in `src/render/atmosphere.ts`. Existing
`createOutdoorSky` and `installOutdoorOcclusion` reach the shared five-world scene.
Replace the Preetham colour override and fixed-colour height fog with LUT-derived
sky, solar transmittance, sunward scattering and height-aware surface extinction.
Keep the GI chain/shadows/exposure unchanged. Biome additions own weather tuning.

- [x] Physical sky, halo and clouds share the biome sun; proof: 1920×1080 scratch playtest captures (`atmosphere-candidate-3`, `atmosphere-edge`), 3/3 checks each, and 1:1 reference crops. Whole-scene Gaia parity remains open.
- [ ] All fog-enabled lit surfaces share LUT air; proof: full licensed and fallback `terrain.playtest.json`, `verify-ocean.mjs`, every view CPU p50 ≤4 ms.
- [x] Required local checks pass; proof: example `tsc --noEmit` exit 0; Biome 73 files exit 0; terrain vitest 69/69; core atmosphere spec 31/31, core build exit 0.

Engine defect: `sampleLut` used integer `textureLoad`, bypassing `LinearFilter`;
filtered reads now use an explicit mip level on fragment and compute paths.
Regression: new sampler assertion red (false), then 31/31 atmosphere specs green;
`pnpm --filter @threenative/core build` passed. The missing physics dist was rebuilt
without source changes. Baseline/final captures remain pending.

The material budget is 15/16 sampled textures before atmosphere, so the air
composite reconstructs world position from the existing scene depth instead of
adding two LUT bindings to every ground/prop shader. The GI chain gets the
result as its input; AO/grade, exposure, shadows and MSAA stay unchanged.
Minimal shared wiring: one `ctx.add(sky.atmosphere)` in `game.ts`. GI integration
must preserve `airOutput` around its scene colour.

Baseline 1:1 crops: `artifacts/playtest/atmosphere-before/*-crop.png` and
`atmosphere-before-extra/*-crop.png` under the example. The first high-density
candidate was discarded after foreground washout; its scratch run also observed
4.2 ms CPU windows (one resource assertion failed, no console/runtime errors).
Lower-density tuning is being captured in `atmosphere-candidate-2`; full licensed
and fallback proof remain pending. The main Gaia acceptance stays open.

Third scratch candidate: **3/3 checks PASS**, no console/runtime errors, every
observed CPU window ≤4 ms. `atmosphere-candidate-3/*-crop.png` keeps near detail
and clearer alpine peaks, with smaller cloud cells towards the horizon. The
finite decorative continuation fades to the same sky radiance; its 2.3 km
ceiling is named in source. Both node and classic material fog are now cleared
while the air composite is active, then restored on disposal. A remaining
one-pixel MSAA edge is being checked with a conservative neighbouring depth
sample in `atmosphere-edge`; full asset-mode proof remains pending.

Final edge scratch proof: **3/3 checks PASS**, no console/runtime errors;
`atmosphere-edge/desert-overview-crop.png` removes the remaining pixel line.
The full licensed run is queued on port 5303; a lock-only exit 75 was retried
after 30 seconds. No thresholds or scenario steps were changed.

2026-10-02 23:03 UTC checkpoint: the full licensed capture has not started;
two attempts returned lock-only exit 75, including a 600-second wait. A third
attempt was interrupted by a termination signal while queued; restarted in a
terminal session. Full licensed/fallback
and ocean verification are still unverified; the fallback runner will move
assets only after it owns the capture lock and restore them on exit. Local
source gates are green. The shared lock, not a shader error, is the remaining
validation constraint.

2026-10-02 final licensed proof: **52/52 checks PASS**, zero console errors,
17 measured views, maximum per-view CPU p50 **3.8 ms**. Ocean verification
passed waves, changed sun direction and sheltered water. Capture folder:
`examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/atmosphere-final/`.
The full original scenario and its thresholds were unchanged.

| World | Whole-scene self-grade /10 | Licensed CPU p50 range (ms) | 1:1 crop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forest | 4.1 | 2.3–3.8 | `overview-crop.png` |
| Coast | 4.1 | 2.2–2.7 | `coastal-overview-crop.png` |
| Alpine | 4.4 | 2.2–2.7 | `alpine-ridge-crop.png` |
| Desert | 4.0 | 1.6–1.7 | `desert-overview-crop.png` |
| Tundra | 4.0 | 2.8–3.0 | `tundra-plain-crop.png` |

These are lane self-grades, not an independent judge or a Gaia acceptance.
Crop names above are in the final folder, use the same 1000×550 pixel crop
at 1:1 as `atmosphere-before/` (forest/alpine/desert) and
`atmosphere-before-extra/` (coast/tundra). The coastal final scenario flips
the sun, so that coast comparison does not isolate atmospheric changes.
Distance separation and the desert MSAA pixel improve; the broad finite
horizon, cloud detail and the visible white tundra sun disc still fall short
of the references. The physical halo is broad rather than a bloom flare;
GI bloom must see HDR sky before grading clamps it.

Fallback attempt: startup returned `TN_PLAYTEST_BRIDGE_MISSING` before any
frames or screenshots; ocean verification consequently could not read its
input PNGs. Assets were restored successfully. A retry used the exact
`pnpm dev` command with saved startup output, but was cancelled while queued
to remain within the 115-minute wall. No fallback frames were recorded.
Fallback startup/runtime/performance proof remains unverified, and its checkbox
stays open. No renderer or vegetation changes were made to conceal this failure.

Final cleanup: licensed `local-assets/temperate` is back in place, the temporary
held-assets directory is absent, and port 5303 has no listener. The unmerged
checkout `.worktrees/prd-466-468-atmos/` is retained (**1.2 GiB**) with requested
local assets and captures; removal is not authorized. No push, merge or PR
comment was made. Documentation checks passed: 2386 links and six suites,
180/180 tests. `prd:progress` remains `prd:75%`, Gaia acceptance 0/1.

### 2026-10-02 — Round 18 atmosphere retuning (round 2 checkpoint)

Reused `Atmosphere`/`AtmosphereLuts`; retained core LUT filtering fix `09897a984`.
Removed the 4× grey sky contribution, excluded absorption from single-scattered
radiance, gated air below 150 m, and reduced distanceScale from 8–20 to 1–2.5.
Rayleigh coefficients and kilometre-distance haze ramps are game-owned biome values.
No exposure, shadow, or GI-chain change. Measurement script is outside the repository:
`/tmp/measure-atmosphere-round2.py`, with actual <150 m/>800 m depth masks in
`artifacts/playtest/atmosphere-round2-depth/`. Sky uses matched blue pixels in the
top 30%, retaining the most saturated 40% of baseline sky to exclude clouds;
luminance is linear sRGB/Rec.709, shadow hue is a circular HSV mean on the darkest
20% of near surfaces (excluding blue water), and contrast is a four-pixel local
luminance difference. Coast has no ridge beyond 800 m: its far mask observes ocean.

TypeScript and example Biome pass; terrain plus core atmosphere specs: **100/100 PASS**.
Two colour iterations passed **3/3 runtime checks**, but sky-colour measurements
remained below baseline in some worlds. Third tuning is being measured; full
licensed/fallback scenarios and ocean checks remain pending. No Gaia acceptance
box has been ticked. Source restoration overlapping a capture startup destroyed
that browser context; stable-source retry passed. One subsequent
`TN_PLAYTEST_BRIDGE_MISSING` startup flake was retried once.

2026-10-03 shadow correction: the darkest near-terrain mean hid a desert
mesa-wall regression (30.81° → 248.96°). Added a fixed wall ROI to the same
measurement script and restored the biome's local aerosol tint above 150 m,
before the remote LUT column. Foreground remains clear below 150 m. Final
licensed proof is running; fallback follows with asset restoration on exit.
An interrupted preliminary capture left its owned Vite listener on 5303;
it was cleared before restarting. No source edits occur during final capture.

2026-10-03 UTC final licensed result: **51/52 checks**, zero console errors,
all 17 camera CPU p50s ≤ **3.7 ms**. The sole failed check is the first
`grounded` CPU window (**4.5 ms**, threshold 4); no threshold was changed.
Ocean verification passes all three checks. Fallback is still running.
Mesa wall hue is now **30.81° → 22.76°** (−8.05°); its earlier purple result
was not accepted. Near and mid-shadow hue means pass in all five worlds.

| World | Sky saturation before→after | Blue dominance before→after | Near linear Y p05/p50/p95 before→after | Far local contrast before→after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| forest | 0.290→0.315 | 0.155→0.165 | 0.0022 / 0.0644 / 0.2213 → 0.0022 / 0.0641 / 0.2224 | 0.00681→0.00165 |
| coastal | 0.110→0.257 | 0.058→0.154 | 0.0138 / 0.0889 / 0.3158 → 0.0107 / 0.0871 / 0.3431 | 0.00198→0.00781 |
| alpine | 0.436→0.503 | 0.207→0.267 | 0.0298 / 0.1426 / 0.1691 → 0.0273 / 0.1417 / 0.1683 | 0.04677→0.02915 |
| desert | 0.352→0.401 | 0.188→0.230 | 0.1626 / 0.2242 / 0.3088 → 0.1615 / 0.2238 / 0.3086 | 0.00414→0.00152 |
| tundra | 0.273→0.305 | 0.120→0.186 | 0.0106 / 0.0555 / 0.1598 → 0.0095 / 0.0540 / 0.1407 | 0.00942→0.00455 |

Coast uses the initial player/ocean view with the original sun, matching
`atmosphere-before-extra/coastal-player.png`. Its far mask is ocean rather
than a ridge, and measured far-water contrast increased; four far-land
comparisons decrease and shift toward horizon sky. Final 1:1 crops are
`artifacts/playtest/atmosphere-round2-final-verified/*-crop.png`, cropped
at (400,0) to 1000×550 pixels, matching the baseline crops. The two Gaia
references were inspected at full resolution. Gaia acceptance remains open.

2026-10-03 UTC fallback finished: 49/52 checks. Failed assertions: resource.GameState.windowFrameMs.throughoutSteps, renderChain.stages.includes, renderChain.contributions.graphOutputChanged. All three ocean checks pass; assets are restored. Captures: `artifacts/playtest/atmosphere-round2-final-fallback/`. Per-view CPU p50s: [{'view': 'forest:player', 'p50': 3.1, 'windows': 27}, {'view': 'forest:meadow-close', 'p50': 2.5, 'windows': 8}, {'view': 'forest:overview', 'p50': 3.4, 'windows': 9}, {'view': 'forest:river', 'p50': 3.7, 'windows': 9}, {'view': 'coastal:player', 'p50': 3.4, 'windows': 22}, {'view': 'coastal:meadow-close', 'p50': 3.2, 'windows': 20}, {'view': 'coastal:overview', 'p50': 2.3, 'windows': 11}, {'view': 'coastal:horizon-sea', 'p50': 2.1, 'windows': 10}, {'view': 'alpine:player', 'p50': 2.2, 'windows': 21}, {'view': 'alpine:ridge', 'p50': 2.2, 'windows': 9}, {'view': 'alpine:overview', 'p50': 1.8, 'windows': 8}, {'view': 'desert:player', 'p50': 1.5, 'windows': 21}, {'view': 'desert:mesa', 'p50': 1.5, 'windows': 7}, {'view': 'desert:overview', 'p50': 1.4, 'windows': 8}, {'view': 'tundra:player', 'p50': 2.5, 'windows': 20}, {'view': 'tundra:plain', 'p50': 3.8, 'windows': 18}, {'view': 'tundra:overview', 'p50': 4, 'windows': 7}]. TypeScript/Biome, 100 terrain/core tests, 2386 doc links and 180 doc tests pass. The zero-failure gate remains open; no push/merge/PR comment. Unmerged checkout retained (1.4 GiB).

### V11 judge (erosion, material, veg and atmosphere lanes merged, 2026-10-02)

Fresh judge, 1:1 crops against the Gaia refs: forest 4.5, coastal 4.0, alpine 2.5, desert 3.5, tundra 2.5,
weighted **3.71/10** (V10 3.84). Near-ground forest (meadow-close) is the strongest view (~5.5); mountain form is
the binding gap: alpine peaks read as identical spikes with snow on the tips, desert mesas as extruded stumps.
Judge's ranked levers: (1) geological mountain form with layered rock and slope/curvature snow, (2) mid/far ground
cover and macro variation for aerial views, (3) crushed-black alpha grass, posterised clouds, tundra shadow
stair-step. Proof on the merged tip: licensed all checks pass with the prop-draw ceiling at 64 (63 draws, every
view CPU p50 ≤ 4 ms, `verify-ocean` green); fallback had transition-only window spikes (4.1–8 ms) while another
lane captured concurrently — re-measure pending. Captures: `docs/verification/visuals/strata/v11-*.jpg`. AC-5
stays open.
### 2026-10-03 — Round 18 GI round 2 checkpoint

Lane `feat/prd-466-468-gi2` starts at merged tip `2d75df9ed`.
Measured live cached WGSL at the tip: terrain **16 samplers / 16 textures**,
canopy **6**, bark **7**, blended rocks **12**, ocean **6**; the existing air/AO
screen composite has **5 samplers / 7 textures**. Counts include four virtual
shadow bindings and Three's **DFG LUT**, which the previous terrain estimate
omitted. Census: `/tmp/gi2-census.json`, `/tmp/gi2-census-coastal.json`;
control captures: `artifacts/playtest/gi2-census/`, `gi2-census-coastal/`.
Terrain cannot receive another material sampler without freeing a slot.

Rebuilt the stale terrain dist and forced the existing bake to populate erosion
arrays; no erosion source or recipe changed. The unchanged full control stopped
at coastal startup with WebGPU `createBuffer` allocation failure (262144 bytes).
RTX 2080 free VRAM was 1.9 GiB while Blender used 2.7 GiB and Warcraft 1.4 GiB.
The sky-fill candidate reuses `Atmosphere` LUT radiance and the existing world
pass, adding an albedo MRT instead of terrain samplers. Visual acceptance,
ProbeVolume bounce, shadow-edge fade and final licensed/fallback proof remain
unverified; no acceptance box is ticked.

GI2 runtime correction: **ProbeVolume is not retained**. Its prop shaders fit
(7 canopy, 8 bark, 13 rock samplers), but no bake reached `ready`; measured first
work items were 213.2, 304.3 and 866.7 ms against a 32 ms budget. Raising that
budget would not prove the requested CPU ceiling. The engine's scene-warmup
escape after two seconds is a suspected contributor, not a verified fix.

Retained game-owned changes: LUT-derived diffuse sky spectrum with warm ground
fill at the biome's existing luminance; fade the outer shadow window over
208–256 m; dispose the example's virtual-shadow targets when a world exits.
The added albedo MRT costs no terrain sampler. Surface correction fades before
1200 m because the sky box itself writes depth; the earlier unbounded candidate
also recoloured sky pixels and was rejected. Atmosphere parameters, exposure
and 4× MSAA/alpha-to-coverage stay as authored. No SSGI/bloom/TRAА change.
Example TypeScript and Biome (73 files) pass; terrain Vitest **71/71 PASS**.
Full safe runtime control and final licensed/fallback scenarios are still pending.

2026-10-03 UTC GI2 final correction: **the LUT-fill candidate is withdrawn**.
The five-world atmosphere comparison did not pass; forest foreground p95 was
0.2993 versus 0.2224. Its reference forest also differs geometrically, so this
comparison cannot establish causality or non-regression. Restored the original
world MRT/normal and air input; no probe, albedo attachment or sky-fill delta is
retained. Final source changes are the 208–256 m outer-shadow fade and explicit
virtual-shadow/light disposal on world exit. Reuses Daylight, VirtualShadowNode,
the existing Atmosphere/aerial perspective and 4x MSAA; no package source changed.

The preceding full licensed runtime control completed all scenario steps with
zero console errors and zero runtime diagnostics (diagnostics assertions only).
Its per-world maximum CPU p50: forest 4.3 ms, coastal 4.2 ms, alpine 3.4 ms,
desert 2.2 ms, tundra 4.6 ms; **the 4 ms gate fails**. These timings belong to the
withdrawn fill candidate, not the final source. Original full licensed final
was stopped to withdraw that candidate; all three ocean checks passed on its
partial coastal captures. Fallback original full scenario was attempted under
the remaining wall limit; completion is not claimed. Final capture locations:
`artifacts/playtest/gi2-final/` and `gi2-final-fallback/` (partial).

Inspected 1:1 candidate crops: `gi2-census/forest-start-crop.png` before and
`gi2-final/forest-start-crop.png` after (candidate withdrawn); other inspected
crops in `gi2-safe-check/`: alpine-ridge, desert-overview, tundra-overview,
coastal-ocean. Subjective grades of these licensed candidate captures:
forest 3.8, coastal 4.0, alpine 4.2, desert 4.3, tundra 3.7 / 10. Gaia acceptance
and five-world non-regression remain open. Terrain tests 71/71 and 2386 doc
links passed; final source TypeScript/Biome checks are recorded below.
No push, merge or PR comment. Unmerged checkout retained (2.7 GiB), containing
local licensed assets and captures; it is not eligible for merged-worktree cleanup.

Final source: TypeScript passes; Biome checks 73 files and passes after assets
were restored. Fallback has no completed world capture; the renderer exited during capture
(`TN_PLAYTEST_PAGE_CRASHED`). Final source has no completed full playtest.

### 2026-10-03 UTC — DEM lane (owner-approved real geology)

Complexity: 3 → LOW; risk override: none. Example-owned authoring and appearance;
installed `Terrain.heightmap`/data stamp imports numerical heights. No package change.
110-minute lane, branch `feat/prd-466-468-dem`, base `2cbf316ca`; no push/merge/PR comment.

- [x] Crop public-domain 3DEP 1 m geology to 257²/512 m and same-site 1/3 arc-second surroundings. proof: `node scripts/dem/crop.mjs` — PASS: four int16 crops, 1,316,872 bytes total; no missing samples, source/project dates, CRS/bbox/USGS citation and SHA-256 sidecars.
- [ ] Integrate DEM bases and real continuation; preserve transport, collision/render identity, cache and packed export. proof: `node scripts/bake.mjs` and `pnpm test:consumer`.
- [ ] Frame real landforms, verify snow/scree/strata, licensed and fallback full scenarios, ocean and gates. proof: full `terrain.playtest.json`, `verify-ocean`, example TypeScript, root Biome and terrain Vitest.

DEM checkpoint: first cold bake 29.44 s; bounded-transport bake 28.20 s.
Maximum DEM change: alpine 0.479 m, desert 0.092 m. All four transport buffers
have 257² finite samples; alpine/desert waters and rivers are empty. Cache reuse
passes. Example TypeScript passes; root Biome checks 78 files (warnings only);
terrain Vitest 71/71 passes. First scratch run crashed in the renderer after a
hardware WebGPU start; second capture is pending. `test:consumer` fails before
export at the pre-existing rain template's missing terrain workflow pointer;
no procedural-shape fixture expectations changed. A focused packed-export run
will exclude only that unrelated template-pointer assertion and is not a full-gate PASS.

2026-10-03 UTC DEM runtime checkpoint: revised scratch scenario PASS (all alpine/desert
steps, walk distances, transport-bound materials, grounded outcrops, zero diagnostics,
1,024/1,024 exact seam samples; maximum contact error 0.0000611 m). Current snow follows
cirque hollows and ledges; exposed convex faces shed it. Tree/grass scatter is removed
from the selected 3690 m glacial shoulder. Cameras face the surveyed headwall and butte.
A wide alpine overview uses an explicit absolute eye above the real surroundings.

Focused packed proof PASS: `/tmp/strata-dem/consumer-world-proof.mjs` replays the existing
consumer script, excluding only the pre-existing rain/snow template-pointer assertions.
All five exported worlds preserve the game's 66,049 heights and 131,072 triangles;
alpine/desert have no water. The installed scaffold/game handoff passes with no authoring
package. Full `test:consumer` remains FAIL on rain; no world-shape expectations changed.
Exported recipes still contain no prop scatter layers (reported as incomplete full-world
art by the existing proof), as before this lane. Final licensed/fallback scenarios pending.

2026-10-03 UTC DEM framing checkpoint: alpine's forced horizon fade now begins at
1,800 m and ends at 3,300 m, so the camera can frame the surveyed headwall without
the previous near-range cutoff. Final alpine/desert scratch scenario PASS, including
world switches/loaded steps and exact continuation seams. Example TypeScript and
root Biome PASS (78 files, existing warnings); terrain Vitest remains 71/71 PASS.
`pnpm check:docs` PASS: 2,498 relative links. Inspected final licensed 1:1 ridge,
overview and mesa crops against the Gaia reference: real continuous headwall,
snow on ledges/hollows and a natural butte skirt; far alpine haze remains stronger
than the reference. No new judge score or Gaia acceptance is claimed. Full final
licensed and fallback gates remain pending at this checkpoint.

### 2026-10-03 UTC — DEM lane final results

Implementation complete on `feat/prd-466-468-dem`; no package source changed.
Sites: Longs Peak Diamond / Chasm Lake headwall, EPSG:26913 bbox
`[447614,4455994,448126,4456506]`, `USGS_1M_13_x44y446_CO_DRCOG_2020_B20`;
Setting Hen Butte, Valley of the Gods, EPSG:26912 bbox
`[605514,4125374,606026,4125886]`, `USGS_1M_12_x60y413_UT_WestEast_B22`.
Same-site 5 km surroundings: `USGS_13_n41w106_20221118` and
`USGS_13_n38w110_20241031`. Public-domain USGS citations, acquisition/project
temporal extents, source URLs and hashes are in `scripts/dem/*.json` and CREDITS.
Example-only dev dependencies: `geotiff` and `proj4`; no installed GIS reader was available.

Bounded cold bake: 28.20 s (first cold bake 29.44 s); cache reuse PASS before
every capture. Baked JSON bytes: alpine 6,094,781; desert 5,974,914; combined
continuation 10,144,458. Four committed int16 sources: 1,316,872 bytes. No
vertical exaggeration; light erosion changes alpine by at most 0.479 m and
desert by 0.092 m. Transport buffers remain finite 257² arrays; no alpine/desert
water or river is created. Render/collision identity and all 1,024 seam samples
pass in the full scenarios; maximum measured contact error is 0.0000586 m.

Final licensed full scenario: **FAIL on timing only**, all behavior, material,
render-stage, collision/seam and diagnostic assertions PASS. Final valid fallback
full scenario: **PASS, every assertion**. `verify-ocean` PASS in both: waves, sun
change and sheltered-water checks. Both use hardware NVIDIA Turing WebGPU at
1920×1080. Console/network/runtime errors: zero in both. Earlier fallback attempts
used a stale local transform matching the old two-argument `loadPack` signature
and are excluded from this proof. Corrected the local fallback config to replace
`loadPack(ctx.assets, world, data)`; verified all three asset-loading calls are
`undefined` in the served module. Final fallback prop triangles are 3,139,276
versus licensed 7,432,934; automatic render tier remains high in the valid run.

CPU p50s below are milliseconds in camera order. Each cell gives its same-run
median one-minute load average (sampled every 5 s). Licensed load range
32.74–57.19; fallback load range 33.75–49.67. These are loaded-machine observations,
not proof that contention alone caused a timing failure.

| World / camera order | Licensed p50s / load | Valid fallback p50s / load |
| --- | --- | --- |
| forest: player, meadow, overview, river | 6/3.9/5.1/8.8 / load 39.62 | 3.2/2.6/3/2.6 / load 38.81 |
| coastal: player, meadow, overview, horizon | 3.3/3.7/3.4/2.7 / load 39.62 | 2/2.3/1.9/2 / load 38.81 |
| alpine: player, ridge, overview | 1.5/1.4/1.5 / load 39.62 | 1.1/1.1/1.1 / load 38.81 |
| desert: player, mesa, overview | 2.7/2.6/2.4 / load 39.62 | 1.3/1.4/1.4 / load 38.81 |
| tundra: player, plain, overview | 4.8/4.7/8.7 / load 39.62 | 2.8/2.1/2.4 / load 38.81 |

Example TypeScript PASS; root Biome PASS (78 files, 49 existing warnings); terrain
Vitest 71/71 PASS; documentation links 2,498 PASS; `git diff --check` PASS. Full
`test:consumer` remains FAIL before export on the existing rain template terrain
workflow pointer (snow also fails the same pointer check). Focused five-world
packed replay and installed game handoff PASS, excluding only those unrelated
assertions: exact height arrays, GLB bounds and triangle count preserved. No
old procedural-shape expectations were changed. The integration/final gate
checkboxes above remain open for the full consumer and licensed timing failures.

1:1 crops (1280×720 pixels, no scaling): before in
`examples/strata-terrain-preview/artifacts/playtest/dem-before/`; after licensed in
`dem-final-licensed-v2/`; after fallback in `dem-final-fallback-valid/`. Each has
`alpine-ridge-crop.png`, `alpine-overview-crop.png`, `desert-mesa-crop.png`,
`desert-overview-crop.png`. Inspected against the Gaia alpine reference: continuous
real headwall/couloirs, snow on hollows/ledges and genuine butte skirts/bedding;
alpine overview haze remains stronger than the reference. No new judge score,
Gaia acceptance or overall PRD completion is claimed.

Source commits: `41cff09ac`, `19a0e88e4`, `b6b365f76`; this final note is committed
separately. No push, merge or PR comment. Unmerged checkout retained with local
licensed art and captures; it is ineligible for merged-worktree cleanup.

### 2026-10-03 UTC — DEM round 2 lane

- [x] Three public-domain 1 m survey crops/provenance committed. proof: GeoTIFF/proj4 commands: `node scripts/dem/crop.mjs /tmp/strata-dem2 forest coastal`, then `node scripts/dem/crop.mjs /tmp/strata-dem2 tundra`. Cold bake/cache PASS; all five 66,049-entry flow/sediment/deposition/talus arrays finite.
- [x] Independent surveyed surroundings and 384-band rings framed for all five worlds. proof: scratch `dem2-pass6` and focused real-display `dem2-timing-licensed` both PASS 4/4, zero errors; 1,024 seam samples at 0 m. 1:1 crops inspected against Gaia and round 1 alpine.
- [ ] Full final gates. proof: licensed aborts on bridge `advance` timeout (20,250 ms) during coastal return, before assertions/timing; actual fallback completes 55/57. Failures remain presented-p95 and forest crags, plus the pre-existing full consumer failure.

Forest: Sprague Lake / Glacier Creek valley, `USGS_1M_13_x44y447_CO_DRCOG_2020_B20`.
Coastal: Sand Beach / Great Head, Acadia, `USGS_1M_19_x56y491_ME_MidCoast_2021_B21`.
Tundra: Trail Ridge basin, `USGS_1M_13_x43y448_CO_NorthwestCO_2020_D20`, 48.1 m relief.
All are 1 m lidar filtered to 2 m playable samples. Five independent 5 km rings use
1/3 arc-second 3DEP: `USGS_13_n41w106_20221118` (forest/alpine/tundra),
`USGS_13_n45w069_20260521` (coastal), `USGS_13_n38w110_20241031` (desert).
BBox/CRS/tile/date/citation/hash JSON and public-domain credits are beside the crops.

Installed Terrain heightmap/hydraulic/thermal/flatten/river, bakeTerrain and Heightfield
reused; no engine changes. Invented detail surfaces/shared noise cones are replaced
by measured geology. Forest lake/creek and tundra pond/braid beds remain explicitly
authored, not surveyed bathymetry. Alpine/desert detail unchanged. No vegetation or
material edits; additive game.ts starts/cameras and existing water-footprint limits only.

CPU p50s (ms, camera order), whole-frame self-grades, and same-run median one-minute
load below; 24 logical CPUs. Licensed values are the focused run, not the aborted full
run. Max presented p95: licensed focused **100.1 ms**, full fallback **116.8 ms**,
both fail ≤16.7 ms. Active load range/median: licensed focused 7.32–16.23/10.54;
full fallback 17.70–51.82/41.27; aborted licensed 21.17–74.35/63.78.

| World / camera order | Licensed p50s / load 10.54 | Fallback p50s / load 41.27 | Self-grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| forest: player, meadow, overview, river | 3/3.1/4.2/3.1 | 4.1/4.2/7.8/4.1 | 4.8/10 |

| tundra: player, plain, overview | 2.5/2.4/2.7 | 2.5/3.3/3 | 5.1/10 |

Both full capture folders pass `verify-ocean` 3/3 and have zero console/network errors;
fallback runtime diagnostics 0. Fallback lake placement/footprint errors 0 m,
contact error 0.00002955 m, all measured seams 0 m. Forest crags: zero mountain
placements because the unchanged scatter requires steep slopes; no assertion weakened.
Example tsc PASS; root Biome 84 files PASS; terrain Vitest 71/71 PASS; doc links 2,509
PASS; whitespace/cache PASS. Full consumer still fails on the existing rain-template
terrain-workflow pointer; focused five-world exact-height/131,072-triangle/water/installed
handoff replay PASS. No independent judge, Gaia acceptance or final gate PASS claimed.

1:1 1280×720 crops, no resizing: before forest/coastal/tundra in
`artifacts/playtest/dem2-before/`, alpine/desert in `dem-final-licensed-v2/`; after/final
folders `dem2-final-licensed/` and `dem2-final-fallback/`. Compare `overview-crop.png`,
`coastal-horizon-sea-crop.png`, `alpine-ridge-crop.png`, `desert-mesa-crop.png`, and
`tundra-overview-crop.png`. Actual asset absence verified; restoration trap restored
`local-assets`, hidden path absent. Port 5297/owned display forwarder stopped and socket
removed. Unmerged 6.8 GB checkout retained with licensed art/captures. No push/merge/PR comment.


### 2026-10-03 UTC — perf lane (120-minute execution window)

Complexity: 3 → LOW for this bounded game-side slice; engine defects, if demonstrated,
require a package spec. Owner-authorized branch `feat/prd-466-468-perf` at `72e0edb16`;
port 5311, commits by path every 30 minutes, no push/merge. Reuse installed FrameBudget,
loadAll, addInSlices and startup readiness. Appearance/density, WorldCells,
auto-LOD/mirror defaults, shadow detail and terrain material are owned by other lanes.

1. Instrument and baseline:
   - [ ] Publish per-view GPU time and per-pass triangles/draws plus ready/load hitch measurements; scenario rejects missing observations and caps GPU at 12 ms, tasks at 250 ms and warm readiness at 15 s. proof: full terrain scenario on hardware WebGPU under private Xvfb.
2. Optimize measured costs:
   - [ ] Reduce measured load/LOD cost without changing art or density. proof: comparable licensed before/after terrain scenario and focused prop check.
   - [ ] Measure MSAA/scaler GPU tradeoff and retain a demonstrated improvement. proof: same-view timestamp-query comparisons.
3. Deliver:
   - [ ] Licensed and trap-restored fallback scenarios, verify-ocean, example tsc, root Biome, terrain Vitest and affected package specs pass. proof: named commands recorded below.

Blocked on: stable 60 fps on the owner's actual 60 Hz display requires a real-display
measurement; private-Xvfb timestamps qualify GPU work, never displayed frame rate.
Trace diagnosis: main-thread HandlePostMessage totals 24,030.6 ms over 43 messages,
with ONE 23,877.1 ms handler (RunMicrotasks), not 310 ms per message. Worker handlers
total approximately 5.1 s. Investigating the microtask continuation before altering
transcode, which already uses shared engine KTX2 workers.

Perf checkpoint 1 (2026-10-03 06:56 UTC): engine layer `pose-measure.ts` now computes
only the exact minimum world Y needed for calibration; upright static meshes use
shared geometry bounds, tilted static meshes retain exact per-vertex Y, skins/morphs/
instances keep the precise path. Focused 600-copy/33,153-vertex tilted benchmark:
379.1 → 139.1 ms, maximum measured clearance error 0 in both. Red spec observed
24 needless vertex visits on one upright copy; grounding/skinned specs now 13/13 PASS.
FrameBudget Long Tasks specs red → green; native/unsupported reports unavailable,
never zero. Package budget/grounding regression subset 62/62 PASS. Game LOD red →
green and sliced/synchronous builder equivalence 2/2 PASS; example tsc PASS.
Runtime proof remains pending: shared GPU queue plus one capture-lock publication
race (`mkdtemp lock/.holder-*` ENOENT), not a game verdict. Baseline server has file
watching/HMR disabled and warmed transforms for original props/core plus telemetry;
subsequent source edits cannot alter its cached modules. No GPU/FPS claim yet.

Perf checkpoint 2 (2026-10-03 07:24 UTC): game layer uses installed `addInSlices`
for prop placement/build and swap-deletes only distance-band crossings; authored density,
materials, thresholds and hysteresis are unchanged. CPU comparison: 6,000 instances,
100 moving-camera updates, 944.2 → 202.1 ms. Slice/synchronous equivalence and repeated
band-crossing editor slots PASS; terrain suite 73/73 PASS. FrameBudget now keeps the
first-frame task boundary for its entire lifetime and publishes resolved GPU frame
ranges; stale bucket results and camera-transition windows cannot enter a new view.
Red/green regression confirmed each measurement defect; bounded reviewer PASS.
Engine layer: the automatically created browser canvas has CSS bounds independent
of drawing-buffer attributes, preventing ResizeObserver's scale-to-one-pixel feedback.
Renderer spec red → green, 34/34 PASS; core budget/grounding subset 45/45 PASS.
Full baseline on NVIDIA Turing/RTX 2080 completed: startup ready 34,130.8 ms;
longest observed main-thread task 8,162 ms. It FAILed: canvas collapsed to 1×1,
so later GPU/view values are INVALID, not an improvement. Licensed comparison now
renders full viewport frames and is running. Core build/publint and example tsc PASS;
repo-root Biome on example and changed package paths PASS (existing warnings only).
Runtime budget boxes stay open pending licensed/fallback runs. No FPS claim or push.

### 2026-10-03 — paperboard foliage root cause, real-display FPS, guardrails

Owner report: imported Fab pines read as flat tan "paperboard" cards with black blotches, while
the same packs look right in Wildwood. Cause, measured by single-change A/B captures (v14→v18):
the vegetation had **no image-based light** (no `scene.environment`, no `envMap`; only a 0.72
hemisphere fill), and the example compensated with tints, a fake emissive, a dead-needle recolour
and radial crown normals. Fix: cutout vegetation draws with its imported albedo, normal map and
cutoff, and carries the CC0 Kloofendal HDRI as its own `envMap` at 1.13 (Wildwood's value). A
`scene.environment` washed the ground white (three r185 WebGPU applies `envMapIntensity` only to a
material's own `envMap`) and was reverted. Fresh judge: vegetation 3.5 → 5/10; overview 4 → 3
(distant canopy pale). AC-5 stays open.

Real display (Xwayland :0, RTX 2080/turing, 1920×1080 @ 59.96 Hz, vsync on, control p50 16.7 ms,
8 s settle, 30 s walking): forest p50 100 ms (10 FPS) → 16.7 ms (60 FPS), mean ~10 → 36 FPS,
45% of frames over 20 ms. Cause of the 10 FPS: `setLevels` allocated per placement over ~216k
placements per camera move (66% of main thread). Prop placement went through `addInSlices` at
256/frame (845 frames, ~1 min of bare terrain); core now time-budgets slices at 8 ms: forest
218,839 props in 9.0 s. Still red in the scenario: GPU ≤ 12 ms (28.8 ms coastal/alpine), longest
task ≤ 250 ms (4.4 s unsliced grass batch build), ready ≤ 15 s under Xvfb, `crags` at overview.

Guardrails: core prints `TN_UNLIT_FOLIAGE` (scene entry and startup ready) for cutout PBR drawn
with no environment; red→green on this game (26 materials/31 meshes without the HDRI, silent with
it); every template AGENTS.md states the convention. Open: retire `prep-fab-temperate.mjs` /
`prep-fab-pines.py` hand prep (rebuilt materials, forced cutoff, stripped normals, 21%/5% card
decimation) in favour of asset-MCP imports; the MCP import has no progress signal and exceeded
the client's 30-minute idle timeout on Common Hazel (it still finished: 64 GLBs, 850 MB uncooked).
The shore lane was merged, judged worse (surf line lost) and dropped.

### 2026-10-03 — authorized PR381 takeover and test-first characterization

The owner explicitly approved PR381 inspection/takeover and stopping competing PR381 writers.
The historical task was interrupted/not loaded and no exact-checkout process remained; no process
was killed. Preserved HEAD `a9acd775d` and all 13 unpublished commits in a verified Git bundle,
plus the dirty material experiment (SHA256 `8692e726985c80b9c6355ab80500284fa009a154d3a3bad32af6f4a772a76752`)
and binary working diff in the task workspace. Licensed local assets remain intact.

Before production edits, focused `prop-lod.spec.ts` ran against actual source: 6 PASS / 4 FAIL.
Existing scheduling/LOD checks and new material identity, whole-model alignment, source ownership
and optional-model fallback checks pass. Proposed material-array, untextured-near-mesh, later-zero-normal
and unique-material-disposal guarantees fail. These are bounded CPU facts, not an explanation of
the pictured visual regression; the untextured-mesh guarantee needs its optional-art policy assessed.
Original v14/v18 forest-start pixels were inspected and reproduce dark rounded versus pale skeletal
canopies. The prior HDRI investigation changed several material terms together and reported a worse
distant overview; isolated matched captures are still required. AC-5 remains open.

### 2026-10-04 — isolated WorldCells decoded-data checkpoint

At exact PR381 base `afae569863dfa781cd3e277abda31359534fe9fe`, branch
`fix/pr381-strata-streaming` adds `WorldCells.load({ data, terrain: false })` so an existing
terrain consumer can supply world-v1 placements without fetching or quantizing a second terrain.
Both missing-data-fetch and missing-unused-heightmap cases were observed red before the fix.
Focused WorldCells, admission and decoded-data suites: **55/55 PASS**, one worker. The new
5,000-placement fixture defers work, drains fully and spends at most the default 2 ms plus one
1 ms injected-clock work unit. Residency, eviction, disposal and malformed-run rejection pass.
Biome passes with existing cognitive-complexity warnings. Core tsc is blocked by unbuilt
`@threenative/playtest/protocol` and `/three` declarations; the complete suite and native proof
have not run. No game wiring, canopy import, GPU profile or FPS improvement is claimed.

Integration still needs to preserve the existing seeded grass/scrub/fern fade in `props.ts`.
WorldCells currently has an asset-wide `maxDistance`, while the game's predicate is per placement:
`seed <= (1 - fade)^2`, with fade starting at 28 m. It is exactly equivalent to a per-placement
reach `28 + (assetReach - 28) * (1 - sqrt(seed))`. The smallest additional mechanism is therefore
an optional placement-reach sidecar consumed by the existing budgeted build/refilter path, rather
than a second culler or one asset/draw per placement. Preserve original variant-group indices
when computing the seed; cell partitioning must not renumber them. AC-5 stays open. The owner's
live canopy files and all other worktrees remain untouched; this lane is retained for parent
reconciliation and has not been published.

### 2026-10-04 — imported prop geometry: tests-first extraction (PR381 lane)

Pinned the world-specific asset reshape that `loadPack` applied inline before moving it: a new
`prop-lod.spec.ts` case loads one fixture in `forest` and `coastal` and asserts coastal grass is
the forest grass scaled 0.55 / 1.35 / 0.55. It passed against the pre-refactor source, so the
reshape was characterized first.

Then a behaviour-preserving extraction in `examples/strata-terrain-preview/src/render/pack.ts`: the
ten inline `world === … && asset === …` scale statements became the `WORLD_ASSET_SCALES` /
`ASSET_SCALES` tables behind `scaleGeometry`, and the per-section pipeline became
`meshSections` / `prepareGeometry` / `repairNormals` / `addRadialCoverage`. Every reshape is a
diagonal scale, so they commute; the alpine mountain 24 m pin stays explicit because it depends on
the source size. `prop-lod.spec.ts` **14/14 PASS**, example `tsc --noEmit` clean, biome clean
(existing cognitive-complexity warnings on `surface` and the asset fan-out remain, unreduced).

Junk audit found nothing safe to delete: no tracked source file in `packages/terrain` or the example
is unreferenced, `measure-embankment.mjs` / `measure-light.mjs` have no by-name reference but are the
reproducible proof tools behind AC-5 and the lighting calibration, and the 109 MB `artifacts/pr381-*`
trees are ignored local A/B captures, not commits. No file was removed.

### 2026-10-04 — paperboard foliage: two concrete causes, both red→green

Owner report: trees read as poor-quality paperboard; the same packs look right in Wildwood
(`~/projects/threenative/sandbox/wildwood`). Comparing the two surfaces' graphs gave two causes.

1. **The custom foliage-normal path bypassed the imported normal map.** `pack.ts` installed the bare
   geometry normal as `normalNode` for forest crowns, and `needleMaterial` overwrote the relief
   `bumpMap` with `normalViewGeometry`. Three's `setupNormal()` returns `normalNode` when set, so
   either assignment *replaces* `materialNormal` and discards the map — a crown of flat cards.
   Wildwood's `createSharedFoliageMaterial` sets `material.normalMap` and never overrides the node.
   Fixed the same way: the custom path now only fills in when the art carries no map
   (`pack.ts`), and the crown keeps its relief bump (`needleMaterial`).
2. **The procedural cutout surfaces had no image-based light.** Only `pack.ts` gave its imported
   surfaces the Kloofendal HDRI as a per-material `envMap`; `createPropSurfaces` never did, so a
   machine without the licensed pack drew every crown, frond and petal unlit. A shared
   `skyEnvironment()` helper now serves both paths, applied to `crown`/`needles`/`pine`/`impostor`/
   `fern`/`petal`, with the game passing the one loaded HDRI into `createPropSurfaces`.

Evidence: new `prop-surfaces.spec.ts` and a new `prop-lod.spec.ts` case were red against the old
source (bare geometry normal, relief dropped) and green after. `prop-lod` + `prop-surfaces`
**17/17 PASS**; example `tsc --noEmit` clean; biome clean. The in-repo WebGPU capture is unusable on
this box (SwiftShader drops the device), so no new pixels are claimed; the unit checks pin the
graph, not the picture. AC-5 stays open.

### 2026-10-04 — IBL A/B: scene.environment is not a net gain, keep per-material envMap

Prototyped the Wildwood-shaped alternative — one `scene.environment = HDRI` at 1.13 instead of a
per-material `envMap` — and measured it headed on the RTX 2080/Xwayland `:0` (the headless
SwiftShader path drops the device and is unusable). Same scenario, same camera history:

| view | mean luma material → scene | ΔE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| forest-start | 0.418 → 0.634 | 28.2 |
| meadow-close | 0.493 → 0.532 | 8.5 |
| overview | 0.491 → 0.581 | 13.3 |

The near-ground bands are where it lands: forest-start's bottom three fifths go 0.36/0.39/0.38 →
0.56/0.61/0.60, and mean chroma spread drops 0.115 → 0.099 — the documented ground wash, confirmed
on real pixels. GPU cost rises too (`gpuMs` median 1.71 → 3.04 ms), because the ground now samples
an environment it cannot opt out of. fps was rAF-throttled (unfocused window, median ~8–9) and is
not a usable signal.

Verdict: **reverted the prototype.** The per-material `envMap` is the smaller, precise route — only
the surfaces that want IBL carry it — and the ground stays as tuned. `pack.ts` + `createPropSurfaces`
keep `skyEnvironment()`; `scene.environment` is not retried without a ground opt-out that actually
works.

### 2026-10-06 — bounded streamed-terrain construction; loading gate still open

The retained kit profile reaches `WorldCells.update → TerrainTiles.follow → createTile → buildLevel`
inside the render callback. A spent admission allowance still forced a whole tile, including every
LOD mesh and safety scan. Engine fix: sampling, normal-grid reads, geometry, bounds and LOD error
checks now resume in 256-sample chunks under the existing allowance. Only completed tiles enter
residency. Camera moves outside the selected ring and disposal release unfinished work; small
camera movements retain it. Unbudgeted calls remain synchronous. Appearance inputs, resolution,
LOD pop/transition thresholds and collision shapes are unchanged.

Actual red-green: spent-budget sampling read 4,225 samples before, at most 256 after; the normal-grid
test read 4,489 before. Geometry/bounds parity and cancellation pass. Independent review found
alternating ±0.1 m camera movement could restart pending tiles forever: red at 1/9 residents after
4,000 updates, green at 9/9 after retaining selected pending work. Six focused terrain/streaming specs
pass **63/63**, plus **49/49** public terrain contracts, with three opt-in benchmarks skipped;
changed-file Biome has no errors. Independent terrain review passed. Package type checks on both
the original and current tile source report the same existing `EventNodeType` error at
`world-impostor-surface.ts:256`; no new diagnostic. The root board, native lane and fresh GPU run
have not executed here.

CPU comparison against the original `72b12bd` terrain source, same sampler/camera, one CPU11 process,
seven trials: median worst slice at 129² falls **8.33 → 2.39 ms**; worst cold/outlier slice
**39.53 → 16.84 ms**. Every height, position, normal, index and bound matches. This measures CPU
construction only; canonical field allocation, game collider callbacks and runtime/JIT pauses can
still overshoot a chunk. Pending one-tile scratch is separate from completed-residency byte counters.
It is neither a 2 ms hard ceiling nor a displayed-FPS result.

Scope remains partial: the direct preview disables streamed terrain and keeps its global ground
mesh; the fix covers the starter's streamed path. The canonical capability audit maps 26 exact
`symbol`/`importPath` entries and the WorldCells options. Loading needs actual spawn-region terrain,
visual and collider coverage, rather than `world.prewarmed` alone; a hold under an opaque curtain
currently prevents the render-cadence admission that would finish it. PR #437 at immutable
`7cce7825d6155124c93fe571cb8965ed235c1d37` has the identical original terrain-tile file and still
has no regional-readiness/startup-admission contract. Align that shared extension before publication.
No #437 mutation, foreign WIP import, quality reduction or publication occurred. K2 stays open.

### 2026-10-06 — spawn loading gate and consumer lifecycle (CPU verified)

Both visible consumers now draw a game-owned loading curtain. The direct preview still owns its
baked global ground mesh and streams props through WorldCells; the copied forest kit streams both
props and terrain through the same engine owner. Neither replaces the streamer or changes authored
placement transforms/count, terrain resolution, LOD thresholds or licensed appearance.

The existing opaque startup gate suppressed WorldCells render admission, deadlocking a hold for
spawn coverage. Render-driven streaming now explicitly opts into admission after initial compilation;
ordinary compute still waits. CanvasLayer can opt into world preparation behind an opaque cover on
later scene transitions too. Actual game-loop regression failed before and passes after the change.
WorldCells reports completed initial runs/chunks as loadedCells and exposes local readinessAt with
completed terrain tiles. Shader prewarmed remains a separate gate; reserved cells are not coverage.
The launch consumer waits for its fixed 60 m spawn region plus prewarm, then latches success while
distant content continues streaming. Spawn eviction after launch cannot disable controls. Failure,
120-second timeout and cancellation remain distinct from the engine's general fail-open startup
policy: failed loading stays covered, names the failure and prevents gameplay input.

The copied kit places its follow camera before loading, shares decoded manifest/placements/heightmap
with WorldCells and whole-world ground collision, checks scene currency across awaits and releases
consumer-owned resources on cancellation/exit. PropColliders uses consistent world coordinates,
including parent-only movement. It retains the original 60 m collision reach. The installed Three.js
runtime accepts EventNode.FRAME while its declaration omits FRAME from the constructor union; an
actual TS2345 baseline regression now passes with a narrow assertion of that runtime-supported value.

Current-source targeted checks: **185 tests across 12 files pass**, including real copied Forest
lifecycle/control execution, failure/cancellation, grounded transform/density, startup/transition and
terrain contracts. Independent startup review reran **9/9** consumer tests and passed. Core and direct
consumer source typechecks pass. The full board, native consumer lane and fresh sealed GPU captures
remain unrun at this checkpoint; K2 and original frame/visual thresholds stay open. Remaining adjacent
API gaps are splat manifest reuse and explicit splat texture ownership. HLOD is a separate authorized
lane: current cell-proxy cook output is not consumed by this runtime, and scatter-only Strata emits no
proxy-eligible chunks. Per-model LOD, fir impostors and merged terrain blocks do not establish HLOD.

### 2026-10-06 — sealed startup diagnostic (GPU red; acceptance remains open)

The authenticated host-display attempt ran both bridge arms at source `af6dfc8`, using sealed
artifact SHA256 `3a0365201a15e53401bd109a3a3442d8bd02a34055375a63bfdd71d49fea953d`,
1920×1080, scale 1, MSAA 4 and the same camera. Both reached 4/4 spawn cells, 9/9 spawn terrain
tiles, 205 nearby prop colliders and completed prewarm, with 64 loaded/resident cells, 4,820 resident
instances and no admission backlog or streaming failures. These snapshots establish the loading
handoff only; their ground-error sentinel does not establish ground contact.

Both arms subsequently lost the WebGPU device on RTX 2080 / NVIDIA 615.71.09 / Chrome
151.0.7922.34. Bridge-off failed at 03:36:20.301 UTC and bridge-on at 03:37:03.592 UTC, with
`A valid external Instance reference no longer exists.` and device-loss reason `unknown`.
The first stack-backed phase was timestamp-query resolution (`_resolveQueries` →
`resolveTimestampsAsync` → `resolveGpuFrame` → `onRender`); the stack may be a consequence of
device loss and does not identify its cause. No evidence establishes premature renderer disposal,
missing adapter retention or memory exhaustion. The earlier sealed `72b12bd` bridge-on capture
has no such signature, but its trace timed out, so it is an incomplete baseline.

The five-second bridge-on trace completed without data loss and ended 2.55 seconds before device
loss. Its fifteen-second measurement crossed the loss and cannot qualify steady rendering. Both
screenshots timed out. Preflight GPU utilization was 37%, so this is functional/diagnostic evidence,
not a controlled speedup or displayed-FPS comparison. Owned browsers stopped and the canonical
capture lease was released at 03:37:22.944 UTC. Raw evidence is retained in
`performance-resume-20261006/focused-runs/2026-10-06T03-35-41.180Z` in the task workspace.
K2, matched screenshots, ground contact and original visual/frame/native acceptance remain open;
no quality or acceptance limit was reduced.

### 2026-10-06 — loading status upload regression (CPU verified; runtime follow-up open)

One candidate-only hardware run at `ea0a0621b988eaa26fa2cd6450f03473cbf3fa17` used
the existing seven WebGPU/performance flags, the original 90-frame warmup and readiness
deadlines, 1920×1080, resolution scale 1 and MSAA 4. It first observed playable spawn
coverage at 116.081 s; final startup/curtain release was stamped at 117.618 s. All six
required spawn cells completed, with 48 resident/loaded cells and 218,809 admitted
placements at the end. The retained initial forest image submitted 18,391 visible prop
instances, 55 prop draws and 12,311,836 prop triangles. No admission error or device loss
was recorded. This establishes candidate loading and initial geometry observations only.

The overall run remains **RED**: `TN_STARTUP_STALLED` reported unchanged 95% progress
at 100 s, and the shortened readiness scenario waived every triviality-eligible assertion.
The original full scenario, frame/visual/native acceptance and matched before/after remain
open. Foreign GPU activity overlapped 12 monitored process samples after a clean launch
guard, so this run cannot establish controlled performance. Raw profiles, exact arguments,
curtain/forest PNGs and cleanup receipts are retained in the task workspace under
`performance-resume-20261006/readiness-qualification/`; no screenshot depicts the later fix.

Independent profile/source review identified repeated status-canvas uploads in the loading
overlay: that call path accounts for 94.433 s of V8 samples, compared with 0.057 s for all
other image-upload paths. Strata marked its unchanged rounded percentage texture dirty
every render. A real Texture.version regression failed at 105 versus expected 4 after
repeated unchanged text. The game now repaints/uploads only when the displayed text changes;
bar/layout updates, canvas resolution, readiness and error messages remain intact. All seven
Strata loading tests pass, including changed-percentage and error-message controls. Runtime
loading-speed improvement remains unverified; the follow-up below records the post-fix failure.
No deadline, quality setting or acceptance threshold was relaxed.

### 2026-10-06 — post-fix qualification (GPU OOM; readiness remains red)

One post-fix run at `afd3ccef62f1dad335f839c71f1384483894e52b` used artifact SHA256
`e9ca2430c17bdc011faf25dabf8998c677bf8be0a5448bd80f0d7a2019b80388`, the same browser,
1920×1080, scale 1, MSAA 4, warmup and original deadlines. Independent rehashing verified
all 323 licensed cooked files (212,536,550 bytes) unchanged. It ran from 08:31:44.292 UTC
for 194.626 s and exited 2. The actual outcome is **RED**: 54 GPU out-of-memory errors
(26 `depthBuffer`, 28 `colorBuffer`), 124 GPU validation errors, terminal spawn-admission
timeout and resource-predicate timeout. No device-loss signature was recorded.

The first OOM console row reports `vkAllocateMemory failed with VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`
while creating the default depth attachment, before props were admitted. Console rows have no
UTC timestamps, so its exact failure time cannot be recovered. Late replies reached all six
spawn cells and 48 loaded/resident cells, but correctly retained `worldReady=false` and
`Strata spawn admission exceeded 120000 ms`. The curtain did not release. A late
`streamingPendingPrewarm=-5` is a separate unresolved counter defect, not evidence of readiness.

V8 sampled image-upload self time was 94.491 s in the pre-fix run and 5.552 s in the post-fix
run (overlay portions 94.436 s and 5.325 s). These are instrumented attribution observations
from runs with different failures and resource conditions, not a controlled loading speedup
or FPS result. The loading regression and 51 affected CPU tests pass; direct strict source
typecheck, changed-file Biome and doc links pass. Documentation contracts pass 242/243 checks;
the existing `docs/verification` tree is 72.7 MiB against its 72 MiB cap, unchanged by this slice.
The new PNGs leave `docs/benchmark` at 164.3 MiB against its 200 MiB cap. Normal consumer
declarations were missing from the local setup, and full-board/native/visual/frame acceptance
remain unrun or open.

Read-only process accounting recorded the run-owned GPU process rising from 805 MiB at
9.708 s to 6,648 MiB at 11.708 s, peaking at 6,701 MiB at 08:32:32 UTC. Processes outside
the recorded tree stayed between 864 and 937 MiB. This establishes allocation pressure in
the run-owned GPU process; it does not identify the source allocator or measure authoritative
free VRAM, driver reservations or fragmentation at the failure. The RTX 2080 has 8,192 MiB capacity.

An independent CPU probe used the sealed runtime's Three 0.185.1 `c2e051df…` patch with a
fake device; the publication worktree's `e5f4c8f8…` dependency has different whole source files.
Its color-buffer cache writes `source.width/height` while texture dimensions read `source.data`.
Three synthetic repeated color-buffer reads allocate three textures and destroy two. A stable
MSAA-4 render-pass descriptor allocates only one depth/color pair; synthetic alternating
4/0 descriptors allocate nine textures, destroy seven and leave two logically live. Strata's
post pipeline and direct overlay expose this sample-switching path. Actual sample transitions,
allocation counts and deferred GPU frees were not recorded, so this establishes churn rather
than an OOM cause or retained leak. No production renderer/tone change was made.

The original [pre-fix forest PNG](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/pre-fix-forest.png)
comes from `ea0a0621b988eaa26fa2cd6450f03473cbf3fa17`; its run reached spawn but failed the
overall gate. The [post-fix curtain PNG](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/post-fix-curtain.png)
comes from `afd3ccef62f1dad335f839c71f1384483894e52b` and depicts loading cover only.
Both are unmodified 1920×1080 captures. They are not matched before/after gameplay evidence;
there is no post-fix gameplay image. Raw profiles, memory timeline, console errors, CPU probe
and cleanup receipts remain in the task workspace's `readiness-fixed-qualification/` and
`oom-diagnosis/`. Owned browsers and monitor stopped; the canonical GPU lease was released
at 08:35:50 UTC. No additional Strata capture is authorized before the next consumer releases
the GPU window. PRD-466 remains 50%; no acceptance box changed.

### 2026-10-06 — default color attachment cache (CPU red → green; GPU hold)

The engine-owned Three patch now fixes the demonstrated default color-attachment cache defect.
It writes dimensions through `colorTexture.image`, which is what Three's width/height getters
read, and requires a live backend texture before reusing the cached size/sample match. The latter
preserves recreation after explicit destruction at the same dimensions. Source and both compiled
WebGPU copies differ by exactly these three lines; no Renderer, CanvasTarget, tone, CSS, surface
resolution, sample policy or native contract was changed. The new patch SHA256 is
`ce6812d83fbe0e932da427b7a85ed3ad48d8e7a66a3c7e3c64f34f4985cc029e`; all 48 lock references match.

Actual methods in the immutable sealed `c2e051df…` runtime failed six checks and passed two:
an initial color request plus 50 unchanged repeats allocated 51 textures instead of one, and
50 alternating 4/0 render cycles allocated 50 color textures instead of one. An isolated copy
upgraded by the real package postinstall passes all eight lifecycle cases, and a second patch
application is unchanged. Source modules and the shipped WebGPU bundle are both exercised with
a fake device; no GPU device initialization or draw submission is performed. Resize/sample replacement,
exact descriptors and destruction/recreation remain covered. All 37 focused attachment,
patch-upgrade, storage, binding, disposal and surface checks pass; strict TS7 test typecheck and
Biome pass. Independent review reproduced the exact-runtime red and candidate green, verified
the three-file delta and passed 12 focused checks.

Depth sample switching is still present: the same 50 synthetic cycles allocate 100 depth
attachments, alternating 1920×1080 sample counts 4 and 1, and destroy each once by final cleanup.
The test establishes logical allocation lifetime, not driver completion or physical VRAM release.
Hardware OOM recovery, readiness, frame/visual/native acceptance and controlled FPS improvement
remain open. The published OOM run and PNGs above predate this attachment fix. GGEZ's separate
1280×720-to-3×3 shrink was traced to missing example-owned full-size canvas CSS; it is not evidence
of a shared renderer resizing defect. GPU hold remains in effect.

HLOD ancestry clarification: published source already includes cook/schema/selection
`710b68c5cc09ee88058c3ebc5c156564d3db95c5`, runtime consumption
`b73d27ce925569ec9c1d23cada4c649e929b3fe5`, far-matrix write suppression
`9b33b68e287f0f17dca6ef8cd7d3109c14e5eae6` and bundle validation
`b954abe23`/`ea0a0621b`. Reviewed `f025c748a9be6f36c3697d58d01ee694d8eeebb2`
is incorporated by equivalent commit `ea0a0621b`. No completed source was dropped. Strata's
runtime adapter emits no cooked cell-proxy records and retains its prepared custom models,
deformation and per-placement reach. This path cannot activate a cooked cell proxy; no hardware
activation counter or HLOD performance improvement was measured. The earlier "stays separate"
wording in the publication comment was corrected to distinguish source integration from activation.

### 2026-10-06 — late prewarm draw accounting (CPU red → green; GPU hold)

The engine-owned `WorldCells` counter regression is reproduced through real fixture meshes and
their first-draw callbacks. Initial readiness clears owed/drawn totals while retaining main draw
hooks for the existing bounded lifetime. A callback submitted afterwards incorrectly made
`pendingPrewarm` negative. An old callback also consumed unrelated, newly streamed prewarm work.
The actual committed baseline fails both controls: settled `0` becomes `-1`, and new pending
work falls from `4` to `3` when only an old hook draws.

Each borrowed callback now keeps its accounting epoch. Clearing the totals advances that epoch;
mesh replacement carries the original epoch forward. Expired callbacks still restore the original
hook, clear the mesh's owed flag and perform caster bookkeeping, but do not consume current work.
New streamed callbacks each decrement the current pending total once. There is no counter clamp
or change to readiness timing, admission budgets, release bounds, density or rendering quality.

All 70 focused WorldCells admission, streaming, static, shadow and lifecycle checks pass, plus
39 Strata adapter/loading and core startup checks. Strict TS7 typechecking of the actual Strata
source and new tests passes; Biome passes with existing complexity warnings. The private test
configuration closes source, bundles and addons over the same reviewed Three dependency; its
initial mixed-addon fixture failure is retained separately. Independent review reran all five
streamed-warmup tests and passed the accounting fix. Carrying an expired hook through GPU mesh
replacement is verified by inspection, without a dedicated new control.

Fresh independent attachment review also passes: 24 focused CPU checks, both exact-runtime red
controls, the three-line source/bundle delta and all 48 patch references. These fixes remain CPU
evidence. The negative counter is not established as an OOM cause, and physical VRAM recovery,
readiness, matched gameplay images, FPS and native acceptance remain open. No additional GPU
capture or heavy build ran during the coordinated hold. The preceding published CI was skipped
and did not qualify the full board. PRD-466 remains 50%; no acceptance box changed.

The normal publication hook initially failed its scaffold byte snapshots (321 other drift checks
passed). All thirteen real no-install `createProject` trees recover their exact published hashes
when only the previous Three patch bytes are restored in memory. The expected fingerprints were
refreshed for that proven dependency change; the full-tree assertion and exclusions are unchanged.
All 66 scaffold checks and Biome pass. No generated gameplay source or quality setting changed.

### 2026-10-06 — attachment-fix hardware validation (depth OOM; readiness red)

One authorized run used exact published source `71940f31eec1e1cd093a86c008a3fc923696bb3f`
and artifact `18c13dca63f68af754aa04930e64fdd74c973e27db2bde9b6f09cb35516a7d0f`.
Independent review rehashed all 353 artifact files, 323 licensed assets (212,536,550 bytes),
five frozen worlds and all 20 Three modules/sourcemap contents. The shipped allocator contains
the three color-cache fix lines; no stale c2/e5 Three is bundled. Quality remains 1920×1080,
scale 1 and MSAA 4, with the original 90 warmup frames, 120,000 ms admission deadline,
60,000 ms resource wait and 360 s outer bound. No GPU retry or concurrent capture ran.

The run exited 2 after 189.89 s: 21 GPU OOM messages, all for `depthBuffer`, 63 validation errors
and 86 console error rows. There are no recorded `colorBuffer` OOM or device-loss messages.
The first OOM was delivered to the host at 09:59:56.355 UTC, before prop admission. Run-owned
GPU framebuffer memory reached 6683 MiB; sampled global usage reached 7782 MiB and free memory
fell to 11 MiB. Outside-tree framebuffer samples remain 866–886 MiB. The sample nearest the first
delivered error still reports 5381 MiB free: separate NVML queries and host delivery timestamps
do not establish physical allocation size or free memory at the GPU's failure instant.

The final actual reply at page 188,344 ms has 6/6 spawn cells, 48 loaded/resident cells and
218,809 placements. Readiness is false with the original terminal error
`Strata spawn admission exceeded 120000 ms`. Across 458 retained actual replies the prewarm
counter stays nonnegative (0–148), and is zero in all three worlds at the terminal sample.
All three worlds also report HLOD loaded/compiled/observed/active/pending at zero, consistent
with this custom adapter's exact source fallback. This is observed HLOD runtime status;
integrated HLOD source remains intact.

The unmodified [attachment-fix curtain PNG](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/attachment-fix-curtain.png)
is 9308 bytes, SHA256 `43872ae4c4110356e1300abfb81e999032476fcb4aa20441d523fe1fa464c7f2`.
The observer verified the curtain across that capture, then stopped at its existing 5 s read
deadline. There is no gameplay PNG or matched post-fix visual/FPS claim. Shared native CPU work
also prevents a controlled speed comparison. Raw profiles, console delivery timestamps, actual
replies and memory timeline are retained in `attachment-fixed-qualification/` in the task workspace.

All ten original owned processes exited, the resource monitor stopped and the canonical capture
lease was free at cleanup. No foreign process was signalled; no further GPU run is requested here.
The remaining depth allocation/lifetime path needs a CPU reproducer before another hardware run.
PRD-466 remains 50%; readiness, full-board/native acceptance and FPS improvement remain open.


### Remaining default depth allocation fix — CPU verified, hardware pending

The remaining failure was reproduced in the renderer mechanism. `RenderPipeline.render()`
temporarily uses working color space and no tone mapping, so its canvas output uses the authored
4 samples. The direct loading overlay restores authored output conversion, whose final canvas
pass uses effective sample count 1. The previous allocator replaced a single canvas depth slot on
every transition: **100 depth allocations in 50 output/overlay cycles**. Separate offscreen scene,
shadow and postprocessing render targets remain independent consumers.

The package-owned Three patch now retains at most **two** default depth attachments per canvas,
physical size and depth format, keyed by the existing WebGPU sample normalization (1 or 4).
Resize, pixel ratio, stencil/reversed-depth format changes, explicit texture/canvas disposal and
allocator teardown retire the owned pair exactly once. The canonical canvas depth texture keeps
its identity and active GPU metadata; actual default-pass descriptors refresh after disposal or
format changes. MSAA, authored tone/color conversion, resolution, asset density and the original
120000 ms admission deadline are unchanged.

**CPU evidence:** the preserved release fails **26 of 34** lifecycle checks; the candidate passes
**34/34 with each shipped WebGPU bundle**, including the real `RenderPipeline.render()` sample
transition, competing canvases and live offscreen depth controls. The focused Three/renderer
contracts pass **67/67**; scaffold contracts pass **66/66** using durable temporary storage below
the installed core consumer. Strict TypeScript 7 and Biome pass. Stock and previous-release postinstall
applications accept the patch and reapplication is unchanged. All thirteen actual no-install
scaffold trees regain their published fingerprints when only the old Three patch is substituted.
Independent review passes. The original hardware result above remains red: this CPU fix does not
yet prove physical OOM recovery, readiness, a gameplay screenshot or an FPS improvement. No new
GPU/native run was performed for this candidate; Phase 4 remains open and progress remains 50%.

### 2026-10-06 — bounded depth validation and async validation-scope correction

The single authorized hardware run of `14aa2c1a99f902a92e7ffd7c7201d6168b87f734`
remains **red**. It exited 2 after 79.15 s with one recorded device-loss event, reason
`unknown`, message `A valid external Instance reference no longer exists.` There were no
recorded GPU OOM or validation errors; the run-owned process peaked at 956 MiB and sampled
global free memory stayed at least 5,737 MiB. These observations do not identify the cause or
qualify OOM recovery. The loss at page time 69,311.6 ms preceded the late curtain release,
adapter-provenance failure and pagehide; no renderer-dispose or device-destroy call was recorded.
The harness therefore received no GameState readiness replies or gameplay frames. The actual
loading cover is byte-identical to the preceding published curtain above. All eleven original
owned process identities exited, the observer stopped and the canonical capture lease was free
at cleanup; no foreign process was signalled. No further GPU run was launched.

CPU diagnosis found a separate, reproducible error-attribution defect in Three's asynchronous
render-pipeline creation: its validation scope remained on the device stack while compilation
was pending, so unrelated loading-overlay commands could enter it. A rejected scope result also
escaped as an unhandled rejection. The package-owned patch now closes the scope before yielding,
attaches its rejection handler immediately and still waits for pipeline creation and scope
results before completing compilation. Pipeline errors continue to mark their own pipeline and
request shader diagnostics. This corrects error observation; it does not establish why the
physical device was lost.

`three-pipeline-scopes.spec.ts` reproduced eight failing checks and unhandled scope rejections
against the preserved release. The candidate passes **12/12 with each WebGPU bundle**, covering
unrelated render errors, the caller's scope, reverse-order pipeline completion, early scope
rejection and delayed scope results. The focused scope/renderer/attachment/package checks pass
**67/67**. Strict TypeScript 7 and Biome pass. All thirteen actual scaffold trees recover their
previous fingerprints by restoring only the previous Three patch; scaffold contracts pass
**66/66**. Stock and previous-release postinstall applications pass and reapplication is unchanged.
Independent review passes for this bounded fix. A pre-existing rejected shader-diagnostic reporter
can still produce an unhandled rejection; it reproduces before and after this correction. The retained CPU profile maps
11.03 s of self samples to loading-overlay queue submission; it is not a steady-state FPS result.
Readiness, matched gameplay captures, FPS and native acceptance remain open; progress stays 50%.

### 2026-10-06 — reach preparation pacing and pre-failure readiness receipt

The single coordinated hardware diagnostic of `2d3a244cd0af59c180ee6b7f84b74b8f6bd11b08`
exited 2 after 192.044 s. Device loss did not reproduce: 192 process samples retained the same
GPU process generation and its initialized crash count was zero. The actual first application
error reported startup stalled at 95%, followed by `Strata spawn admission exceeded 120000 ms`.
No gameplay frames were evaluated. The 459 readiness replies began after the admission error;
later replies reached 48 loaded cells, zero pending prewarm and zero admission backlog while
`worldReady` remained false. Timeout latches failure without disposing the worlds, so those later
counters do not establish what was pending at failure. The browser exited normally during runner
cleanup; all owned identities exited and the canonical GPU lease was released.

CPU diagnosis found a separate registration barrier in `WorldCells.load`: both reach preparation
passes yielded a host turn after each 512-record unit regardless of measured work. A real decoded
65,537-record regression reproduced 256 such turns with a controlled cheap-work clock. Both passes
now use the existing 8 ms measured scheduler, with one host yield separating their independent
budgets. The regression takes one fixed turn; a spent-budget control still yields, and a
phase-ordering control proves indexing starts after a host turn. Validation, 512-record units,
2 ms admission, placement transforms/count, canopy reach, rendering quality and deadlines remain
unchanged. This is a CPU-verified scheduling fix, not proof that the hardware timeout is cleared.

Strata's existing preparation path now reports its current pass and bucket through
`addInSlices.onProgress`. Before the spawn gate rejects, `TN_STRATA_SPAWN_FAILURE` captures a
bounded scalar receipt: scene/world generations, attachment/release state, preparation counts,
asset ledger, startup compile/warmup milestones, exact spawn coverage, settled prewarm promises,
and live admission/prewarm counters. Its observer
cannot settle or cancel the gate, replace the original error, or mutate the receipt through later
world changes. Output keeps at most four worlds and four pending paths, retaining total counts;
Unicode, escaped-control and lone-surrogate controls stay below 16 KiB. A real blocked
`WorldCells.load` integration captures `world-load` and zero constructed worlds before timeout,
then verifies that later completion leaves that receipt unchanged.

The five source-aliased CPU suites (`world-cells-data`, `world-cells-admission`, `streaming`,
`prop-streaming`, `strata-loading`) pass **89/89**. Strict TypeScript 7 passes against actual
Strata/core source and the changed tests; Biome exits 0 with existing complexity warnings.
The retained profile's first 120 seconds attribute 52.94 s of inclusive samples to loading-overlay
rendering and 53.68 s to queue submission; these overlap and can include blocked native calls.
They do not separate driver compilation, GPU execution and upload cost or establish steady FPS.
No additional GPU/native run or broad build was performed for this CPU slice. Readiness, matched
playable screenshots, FPS and full-board/native acceptance remain open; computed progress stays
**50%** (2/4 phases, 7/13 boxes). No acceptance box changed.

### 2026-10-07 — reuse unchanged view medians (CPU verified)

The retained `6810f726` loading profile includes repeated median sorting in Strata's physics
callback. Its retained frame-window arrays only append when a budget window closes; reporting
them between windows previously cloned and sorted the same samples again. The consumer now
caches each append-only array's upper-middle median until its length changes. Replacement arrays
remain independent, original sample order is preserved, and the weak cache does not retain old
scene arrays. Freshly mapped pass/surface summaries still sort; this does not remove all reporting
work or diagnose the pending texture upload.

The actual work-budget regression failed with 120 sorts for 120 unchanged reads, then passed with
one sort and one further sort after append. The source-aliased `strata-view-statistics` and
`strata-loading` suites pass **19/19**; strict TypeScript 6 against actual Strata/core source and
the new test exits 0. Biome exits 0 with seven existing game complexity warnings. No rendering,
placement, texture, admission budget or deadline changed. GPU/native and matched before/after
FPS verification remain unrun for this slice. Computed progress remains **50%**; no acceptance
box changed.

### 2026-10-07 — defer world draws until streamed props attach (CPU verified)

The frozen upload-boundary run completed all 41 compressed uploads before the spawn deadline
failed during grounding at 165,030/218,809 entries. Grounding subsequently finished all 218,809
entries in 26,253.2 ms across 440 measured 8 ms slices. Between the first sampled grounding
callback and the deadline, grounding stacks accounted for 2,484.5 ms of the 18,620.4 ms interval.
Independent profile review found separate 2.178 s and 1.705 s long tasks in world rendering;
another 4.740 s task belongs to overlay submission. These are sampled wall intervals, including
blocked calls, not GPU timings. Moving the world draw handoff cannot address the overlay task.

Strata enabled world draws before preparing its streamed props, although no stream was attached
to receive updates or prewarm draws. The consumer now retains the opaque curtain's existing draw
gate through grounding and package preparation, then enables world draws after `ctx.add` registers
the returned streams. `WorldCells.load` returns without awaiting prewarm; the registered worlds
still receive their actual main/shadow prewarm draws before the readiness gate can settle.
Undefined or released preparation never enables those draws. No grounding algorithm, terrain or
physics query, position, collision, seed, population, quality, admission budget or deadline changed.

Three controls executing the production preparation controller failed with premature world draws,
then passed after the handoff moved. The source-aliased loading, prop-streaming, prop-LOD,
compute-driven, main-cull and shadow-prewarm suites pass **80/80**. Strict TypeScript 6 against
actual Strata/core source exits 0; Biome exits 0 with seven existing game complexity warnings.
Same-scenario hardware qualification remains pending for this slice; no readiness, screenshot or
FPS improvement is claimed. Computed progress remains **50%**; no acceptance box changed.


### 2026-10-07 — actual load/walk and measured held-work stall detection

The published draw-handoff/median source reached forest and coastal readiness and completed
11.404 m of scene-local coastal walking at the preserved 1920×1080, MSAA4 and full asset density.
Forest grounding completed 218,809 placements in 11,198.0 ms; the preceding failed diagnostic
completed the same population in 26,253.2 ms. Coastal completed 144,192 in 5,128.2 ms. These runs
include multiple published changes, so the wall-time difference is not isolated causal evidence
or an FPS acceptance result. The run passed 11/12 scenario checks and exited 1 solely because
`TN_STARTUP_STALLED` reported 45 s at a fixed 95% while held work continued; actual readiness
arrived at 115,762.6 ms. No network/runtime diagnostic or spawn failure occurred. The retained
forest-ready/coastal-ready/coastal-walked captures exist, and independent cleanup passed all
12 owned identities, executor exit, canonical lease release and monitor termination. No foreign
process received a signal.

The engine watcher now observes completed asset and held-work units separately from display
percentage and names outstanding startup holds. Existing `startup.hold` takes an optional
completed-work observer; the count cannot regress, invalid observations get no credit, and
settlement freezes the final observation and releases its closure. The existing bounded texture
preparation call reports only unique textures whose preparation promise has resolved. Strata
forwards those completions and actual preparation-slice/cell/prewarm counts. There is no time or
frame-count heartbeat. The 45 s stall threshold, 120 s admission deadline, 2 ms upload lane,
8 ms preparation slices, texture identities/mips, population and appearance are unchanged.

The two behavior regressions failed before implementation and pass afterward; expanded source
checks cover fixed-percentage progress, subsequent real stalls, invalid/regressing observations,
settled observer lifecycle, original hold expiry and the production consumer controller.
The six affected suites pass **84/84**; four framework startup/game suites and three boundary
checks pass, with one existing visual-boundary failure (**64/65** across that group). The same
boundary failure reproduces against the unchanged published source: `world-cell-proxy.ts` imports
`Material` and `world-package.ts` contains `materialGroups`; neither file changed in this fix.
Strict TypeScript 6 against actual source/tests exits 0, Biome exits 0 with 16 existing complexity
warnings, documentation checks pass 2,464 links across 1,259 files, and the context table is in sync.
Texture progress is measured per completed texture, so a single texture that makes no observable
completion for 45 s can still trigger the diagnostic; the granularity does not relax its threshold.
The changed-source hardware rerun and steady FPS/native qualification remain pending. A fresh
visual review still identifies bright needle filigree, card-like lower sprays and weak tree
shadow grounding; readiness does not qualify those appearance defects. Computed PRD progress
remains **50%**; no acceptance box changed.


### 2026-10-07 — source-bound captures and remaining admission blocker

The exact published `88af7c59b` run exited 2 after 189.43 s. The false startup-stall report did
not recur, but the original 120 s spawn deadline failed during grounding at 71,867/218,809.
All 41 compressed uploads completed (3,173 writes; 187,346,672 bytes); the last completion was
at page 115,065.7 ms. Grounding subsequently finished all 218,809 placements in 17,470.9 ms
across 834 original 8 ms slices. The retained tail's 11 validation waits total 1,791.1 ms
(median 147.7 ms, max 368.1 ms); this is neither the complete upload duration nor GPU timing.
The original guards admitted GPU 1% and 8.8 GiB available memory. During execution, available
memory fell below 8 GiB and CPU/memory pressure rose, so this is not isolated performance
attribution. No other owner's work is identified or signalled. Twelve original owned identities,
executor, canonical lease and monitor all passed cleanup. The failed artifact is preserved and
will not be retried. Late texture completion leaves too little headroom for full grounding;
steady FPS and changed-source load/walk acceptance remain open.

Actual PNGs, copied without pixel changes, are retained below and attached to PR #381:

- [Ready forest, source `6cff71c04`](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/forest-ready-6cff71c04.png): 1920×1080, scale 1, MSAA4, full licensed assets/density; the run reached both worlds and walked, but exited 1 on the false startup-stall diagnostic. The independent judge still identifies bright needle filigree, sheet-like lower sprays and weak shadow grounding.
- [Ready coast, source `6cff71c04`](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/coastal-ready-6cff71c04.png): the same settings and result; no trees in this framing.
- [Loading curtain, source `88af7c59b`](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/loading-curtain-88af7c59b.png): the same quality settings; real spawn deadline failure, no ready frame.

These images are different phases and cannot demonstrate a matched visual improvement.
Original source/build/image hashes remain in the owned capture receipts. The existing benchmark
evidence tree has room; the already over-budget verification tree is not enlarged.

| Canonical criterion | Recorded earned evidence | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRD-466 AC-1/2/3/4/6/7/8/9 | Authoring and ordinary Three geometry, browser/native contacts, replacement/discovery, five-world portable export and spectral ocean; 8/9 historical criteria checked, with the limits beside each proof | Current loading headroom and steady FPS remain unqualified; past proofs are not fresh qualification of this build |
| PRD-466 AC-5 | Partial terrain relief, drainage, talus, mesa benches and defining views | Final art/atmosphere in all five worlds, tundra ice lake, existing cooked-starter budget/offline requirement; close needle/trunk/card and terrain views with independent pixel judgments |
| PRD-467 | 9/9 canonical editor criteria recorded checked | Existing fixture/platform limitations remain; no new runtime claim |
| PRD-468 | 8/8 canonical camera/environment/import/handoff criteria recorded checked | Existing fixture/platform limitations remain; no new runtime claim |

The phase tracker still computes **50%**. No acceptance checkbox was changed or new gate invented.


### 2026-10-07 — bounded compressed validation candidate

The texture utility now permits at most four validation batches in flight while retaining
original 2 ms host slices and 64 KiB writes. It pops scopes synchronously before yielding,
collects both scope results with `allSettled`, and drains every issued result before successful
completion or reporting an upload error. Texture version, mip/layer identity, disposal and
cancellation checks remain in force. Caller cancellation still rejects promptly; the common
texture manager retains its backend lane until the cancelled work drains, preventing a queued
texture from multiplying the four-batch bound. No submission, fence, asset, mip, density,
resolution, deadline or diagnostic threshold was added or reduced.

Tests through actual Three `Renderer.prepareTextureAsync`, its texture manager and WebGPU
utility reproduce 15 serial-validation failures and three early-successor failures before the
fix, then pass in source and both shipped bundles. The affected suites pass 145 checks across
seven files. Strict source/test TypeScript 6 passes; Biome reports only the existing compressed
coverage test complexity warning. Fresh-stock and the previously qualified pre-method package
installations produce exact candidate utility, common-manager and bundle bytes and are
idempotent. The unreleased serial PR checkpoint is not a supported in-place patch upgrade:
the existing installer can duplicate a changed inserted method there; that failed control is
retained and excluded from qualified fixtures. No installer redesign is claimed.

The candidate's unchanged load/walk scenario is next. The preceding runtime remains red,
steady FPS/native and final five-world art remain open, and computed PRD progress remains
**50%**. No acceptance box changed.


### 2026-10-07 — bounded validation load/walk passes

The exact published `2eb318859` candidate completes the unchanged load/transition/walk with
**exit 0 and all 12 assertions passing** in 122.26 s. The forest reports readiness at 61,089.2 ms. Later passive facts verify all 218,809
placements and 48 cells resident, spawn coverage 6/6 and no loading failure. Readiness and full
residency are separate observations: the first true `worldReady` sample at page 60,087.8 ms
still records 35 loaded cells and an admission backlog of 12 behind the curtain.
Coast transition completes with all 144,192 placements and 45 cells resident, spawn coverage
3/3; the scene-local measured walk is 10.804 m. The report's larger total distance includes the
scene teleport and is not walked distance. Actual surfaces remain 1920×1080, scale 1, MSAA4.
Console, network and runtime diagnostic assertions are evaluated and pass; no retained device
loss or GPU-process failure exit. Twelve original process identities, executor, global lease and monitor
pass final cleanup. An intervening separate lease observation was preserved and left untouched.
The artifact was consumed once, with no retry.

| Retained fact | Previous `88af7c59b` | Candidate `2eb318859` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forest utility job 41 completion, page time | 115,065.7 ms | 44,652.5 ms |
| Forest returned writes / bytes | 3,173 / 187,346,672 | 3,173 / 187,346,672 |
| Full forest grounding / original 8 ms slices | 17,470.9 ms / 834 | 8,393.7 ms / 478 |
| Forest ready / full population | Original 120 s admission failed at 71,867/218,809; later grounding completed with the error retained | 61,089.2 ms / 218,809; ready true |
| Fresh guarded available memory | 8.751–8.975 GiB | 18.565–18.609 GiB |

These are actual observations, not isolated causal speedup or steady FPS evidence. Both runs
use the same hardware, camera/scenario, assets, placement quality and original guards; ambient
memory differs materially. Utility completion precedes the common-manager completion gate.
The new bounded private summaries retain peak four validation batches, 15,796.2 ms in forest
cap-wait phases and 22,775.9 ms in final drain phases. Those are callback/wall phases, not GPU
execution or complete validation latency. Final 45 summaries retain 3,289 writes and
192,939,184 bytes; the diagnostic caps output at 64 summaries.

The retained coast-transition task is still 2,809 ms. Profile samples place 2,207.8 ms in
loading-overlay ancestry, including 2,201.6 ms self in `_copyImageToTexture`; other samples
include BVH construction. This locates remaining JS/native-wait ownership and does not prove
GPU duration or an image-copy cause. Steady FPS and native-host qualification remain open.

Matched camera frames, copied without pixel changes and independently judged:

- Forest: [before, source `6cff71c04`](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/forest-ready-6cff71c04.png) and [after, source `2eb318859`](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/forest-ready-2eb318859.png).
- Coast: [before, source `6cff71c04`](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/coastal-ready-6cff71c04.png) and [after, source `2eb318859`](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/coastal-ready-2eb318859.png).

The independent pixel judge finds aligned framing/placements and no obvious density or surface
regression. Coarse needle/card foliage, weak visible trunk grounding, the broad coast water-color
division and stepped shoreline remain. Wind/wave phase differs; the images demonstrate a loaded
world with retained appearance, not a visual defect repair or FPS gain. Final five-world art and
portable kit/performance qualification remain unfinished; computed phase progress is still
**50% (2/4 phases, 7/13 phase boxes)** and no acceptance box changed.

### 2026-10-07 — preserve authored crown normals (CPU verified, matched runtime pending)

A fresh judge inspected the twelve original four-arm player, meadow-close and overview images.
Both authored-normal arms reduce the broad chalky left-crown faces; switching specular alone
does not. The game now keeps authored crown normals by default, including omitted comparison
options and near/far sections. Radial normals remain an explicit same-asset probe. Interior
coverage/AO, imported normal maps, disabled specular, trunk normals, alpha cutoff/coverage,
wind/shadow nodes, assets, placement, density, LOD and camera settings are retained.

Five relevant assertions first failed against the radial default; the changed source passes all
32 focused prop/pack/startup/lifetime checks. Current-source matched images and steady-frame
measurement are pending. Historical authored arms had runtime failures and are image evidence
only, not accepted runtime proof. Card outlines and granular needle edges remain. No art, FPS or
native gate is claimed; computed progress remains **50% (7/13 phase boxes)**.

### 2026-10-07 — matched authored canopy and standing-view evidence

Runtime source `2d093a4fc58334de6ddd04f873d9bc9564b330a7`, artifact
`8d8accaf99e151a3de8d0c0d7c462ac477e30641ba00eb48ced98fdfebff4e94`: two fresh
launches use the same compiled source and frozen 323 licensed/cooked asset files. The baseline
explicitly selects radial/disabled; the candidate uses the authored/disabled default. Both
retain 1920×1080, scale 1, MSAA4 and the same three cameras, each held for 600 live-clock ticks
(10 seconds requested wall time; actual spans include bridge overhead). Original readiness,
admission, resource and lease guards remain. Each arm ran once with zero retries.

Both runs exited 0 and passed 25/25 checks. Every compared sample retains 218,809 instances,
48 loaded/resident cells, 6/6 spawn coverage and zero unfinished/error counters. Readiness was
60,474.9 ms radial and 82,874.7 ms authored; process durations were 247.637 s and 239.526 s.
These observations do not establish a load-time gain. Both cleanups verified twelve original
process identities exited, executor absent, monitor stopped and canonical lease clear, without
foreign signals.

A fresh independent judge accepts the **partial visual milestone**: authored crown normals
clearly reduce broad chalky faces in the matched meadow closeup. Sampled meadow/overview poses,
lights, aggregate geometry counts and surface settings match; wide forest arrangement, trunks,
gaps and terrain show no obvious regression. Layered card outlines, granular needle/ground
edges, dark interiors, weak tree grounding and the smooth terrain band remain open. Player
poses differ 2.86 cm and aggregate triangles differ by 243; exact wind phase and per-tree LOD
equality are unproven. Sample-to-PNG timing and complete light transforms are not serialized.

| View | Before: explicit radial | After: authored default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Player | [Original PNG](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/canopy-player-radial-2d093a4fc.png) | [Original PNG](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/canopy-player-authored-2d093a4fc.png) |

All six PNGs are unmodified capture bytes, hash-checked during copying. Benchmark evidence is
193.78 MiB, below its unchanged 200 MiB limit. No licensed model/texture bytes are committed.
Documentation links pass (2,477 links across 1,259 Markdown files); the required six-file
documentation suite passes 242/243 checks. Its sole failure is the pre-existing tracked
`docs/verification` budget (73.0 MiB against 72 MiB), unchanged by this canopy slice. The cap is
not raised and unrelated evidence is not removed.

Steady performance remains open. Final existing per-view GPU medians of window means are
player 4.89→4.90 ms (12→13 windows), meadow 14.30→13.79 ms (9→15) and overview 16.35→14.46 ms
(9→2). These are not p95, physical-display cadence or proof of a speedup. The candidate has
no fresh overview GPU entry at its screenshot assertion; two appear only in the final sample.
Player CPU aggregates include loading, so they cannot qualify standing-view CPU performance.
Repeated multi-second native-call waits also remain: the radial 4,961 ms task is in a settled
meadow interval, mapped mainly to Three's surface descriptor acquisition; radial player and
candidate settled meadow tasks map mainly to submission. Sampled JavaScript/native-call wall
ownership does not establish GPU execution duration or driver cause. The earlier 2,809 ms
overlay image-copy task remains a separate measured open issue.

The settled profiles identify a concrete next CPU target: WorldCells bundle-safety graph
validation/traversal (`graphSnapshotCurrent`, `captureBundleGraph`, `samplesFramebuffer` and
callees). This finding does not justify dropping graph-mutation checks or changing HLOD policy.
The original GPU/CPU bars and full quality remain; no FPS gate is ticked.

The newer shared desktop host `14bc0aec4ef44b743a65b7cbb24e76bc84037d6564187410739e9234e6885058`
passes source-identity review against current native tree `cbd661d372747dd33aceaa18f92b4aac192b0cec`:
884 native files, 114 recorded compiler/Rust inputs, seven toolchain binaries, 149 shared
libraries and 21 generated runtime scripts match. This qualifies reuse without a rebuild,
not current Strata native acceptance. Current game/production-Three/assets binding and the
existing desktop scenario still need execution; the older checkout-binary mismatch is
historical and does not apply to this shared host.

| Open phase box | Original proof still needed |
| --- | --- |
| AC-5 | Final five-world art/atmosphere, tundra ice, offline/cooked-starter budget; `starter-assets.spec.ts` plus actual `test:terrain:web` and `test:terrain:desktop` benchmark rubric captures |
| K1 | Packed CC0 forest adoption, contacts, per-asset collider and offline water/props: `starter-kit.spec.ts` plus `test:consumer` |
| K2 | Adopted CC0 kit: GPU p95 ≤14 ms, CPU frame p95 ≤16.7 ms, cooked ≤25 MiB; fresh-game per-view observations |
| K3 | Every adopted-kit rubric row passed by a fresh judge, with before/after on the PR |
| K4 | The same K1–K3 proofs for coast, alpine, desert and tundra, including kettle ice |
| K5 | Installed docs/capability-only adoption plus an actual cold-agent run recorded on the PR |

K2 concerns the adopted CC0 kit; these licensed-preview measurements cannot earn it. PRD-467
and PRD-468 retain their historical 9/9 and 8/8 criteria, with their existing limits. No HLOD or
native-FPS gate is invented. Computed progress remains **50%: 2/4 phases, 7/13 phase boxes**.

### 2026-10-07 — re-evaluation: static receivers sampled frozen shadow inputs

The owner reported that the meadow still looked low quality ("shadow issue, or the texture?").
Measured on the forest meadow view (RTX 2080, Chrome WebGPU, 1920×1080, MSAA 4, licensed assets):

- **Cause (engine, `packages/core`).** `VirtualShadowNode` kept its window centre, light basis,
  per-level `mapped`, offsets, extent and guard in plain `uniform()` nodes (three's object group).
  The three patch skips object-group uploads for a settled static object, so static terrain and
  streamed props sampled the shadow inputs they settled with at startup.
- **Discriminator.** In the running page, `material.needsUpdate = true` on every material (no light
  change, no map re-render) moved meadow luma 67.8 → 92.4; `invalidateAll()` alone moved it by 0.0.
  The startup state reproduced 6 of 6 runs; hiding casters, the hidden `daylight-sun` shadow and
  cached pages were each ruled out by a same-page control.
- **Fix.** `43f97d8e2` moves those inputs to `renderGroup`. Startup meadow luma 67.8 → 88.2 with no
  rebuild; a forced rebuild now adds +2.0 (was +24.6); crown luma 76.2 → 67.7 (crowns self-shadow).
  `virtual-shadow.spec.ts` asserts every scalar/vector receiver uniform is render-group and fails
  without the fix; 146/146 shadow specs pass.
- **Same class, game layer.** The prop wind clock and canopy sun in `propMaterials.ts` move to
  `renderGroup`, because world-cells marks the prop meshes static and the same freeze applies.
  Measured meadow frame-to-frame motion is noisy: 6.57 before, 13.08 and 8.44 after (crowns 11.73
  before, 12.91 and 9.76 after); no wind improvement is claimed from these three runs.
- **Fresh judge (BEFORE → AFTER, 0–10).** Ground 3 → 5, trees 4 → 5, lighting/grounding 2 → 4,
  sky 6 → 6, overall vs Gaia/Unreal references 3 → 4. Ranked remaining defects: no sun structure
  (no tree shadows or dappled pools on the meadow), no trunk contact occlusion, uniform
  sticker-like tall grass, dark repeated crowns without translucency, no depth haze. Captures:
  [before](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/shadow-receivers-before-9977b16fa.jpg),
  [after](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/shadow-receivers-after-43f97d8e2.jpg).
- **Not the textures.** All 55 live textures carry full GPU mip chains; KTX2 files carry full
  chains. The owner's screenshots were 255-colour palette PNGs, which posterize the sky; the
  true-colour capture's clouds are hard-edged by the deliberately narrow coverage ramps.

Re-evaluation of the open boxes:

- Every visual verdict before `43f97d8e2` (rounds 9–18, V10/V11 judges, canopy evidence) was graded
  on frozen shadow inputs and does not count toward AC-5, K3 or K4. Light, haze and grade constants
  tuned in those rounds need re-checking on the fixed baseline before more tuning.
- The judges' recurring "weak shadow grounding" was this defect, not art. The next visual lane is
  the ranked list above, starting with sun structure and contact occlusion.
- Other defects found: a failed KTX2 fetch leaves a white untextured prop and the run continues
  (should fail closed or retry); `?tnShadowLevels=1` lost the device in 2 of 2 runs; the committed
  lockfile pinned one importer to a stale three patch hash (`b75ce28ca`).
- Device loss "A valid external Instance reference no longer exists" occurred while host load was
  60–135 from CI jobs; GPU-watchdog starvation is a hypothesis, not a proven cause.

Light budget on the fixed baseline (meadow view, luma removed by switching each source off):

| Source | Share of meadow light |
| --- | --- |
| Per-material sky `envMap` (`skyEnvironment`, intensity 1.13, unshadowed) | ≈50% |
| Sun (backlit view / sun moved behind the camera) | 22% / 30% |
| Hemisphere fill | ≈5% |
| Residual with every light and env map off (haze in-scatter, unattributed) | ≈29% |

A clear-day sky is roughly a quarter of the sun, so this balance cannot show the judge's first
defect, sun structure: the sun's shadow can darken the meadow by at most its own ~25% share.
Cutting the env map to 0.35× with the sun at 1.8× was rejected: the dense `fieldGrass` cards lost
their main light and the meadow went back to dark speckle. That speckle was the layer's own
near-black root albedo, (0.025, 0.052, 0.008) linear. Lifting the root to (0.06, 0.10, 0.025) and its
root AO from 0.35 to 0.55 is kept: near-meadow pixels below luma 30 fell 2.0% → 0.2%, p10 39 → 54,
and a fresh judge scored the ground 3 → 3.5 ("keep; small improvement";
[capture](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/field-grass-lifted-root.jpg)). The sun/env rebalance is
the next lever and needs the grass lit by more than the env map first.

Rejected round (not committed as code): forest sun 5.8 → 9.3, non-canopy forest `envMapIntensity`
0.5, and an upward normal for map-less forest ground cutouts. Meadow p10/p50 54/93 → 38/81 and the
speckle returned; sun share rose only 22% → 35%. The dense grass cards stay sky-lit even with an
upward normal, so the next lane should inspect which pack layer draws the meadow (its normal and
alpha-to-coverage at distance) before another light rebalance.

Kept round (`56cadfecf`): at 2× the meadow "texture" was sub-pixel blade slivers dithered by 4×
MSAA alpha-to-coverage, and needle edges sparkled the same way. The forest chain now adds a `traa`
stage with MRT velocity and renders its world pass single-sampled, because TRAA copies that depth
and a 4× target produced 747 WebGPU validation errors per run. Opaque foliage no longer averages with
soil and sky, so forest exposure rises 0.45 EV. Fresh judge, same camera: ground 4 → 6, trees
4.5 → 5.5, overall vs reference 3.5 → 4.5, 0 console errors
([meadow](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/forest-traa-meadow.jpg),
[player](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/forest-traa-player.jpg)). New artifact: 1–2 px
stair-steps on silhouettes against the sky. Not verified: ghosting in motion, the other four worlds
(they keep MSAA), native desktop. `terrain.playtest.json` (web, `--browser-recipe webgpu`) is RED at
its first step in both arms on this host on 2026-10-07: `GameState.worldReady` did not arrive within
60 s with TRAA and with `?off=traa` (host load 10–35), so the scenario neither proves nor
disproves this change. Engine follow-up: the render chain should fail closed when `traa`
is requested on a multisampled pass instead of emitting per-frame validation errors.

Three lighting rounds on top of TRAA, each rejected and reverted:

- Non-canopy forest `envMapIntensity` 0.55 with sun 8.7: meadow 82.5 → 58.6, sun share only 28%.
- Backlit `lightNeedles` transmission (0.7) on forest pack grass and scrub: meadow 82.5 → 81.4, no
  visible change at this camera (the sun is ~53° off the view axis).
- Sun elevation ~36° → ~21° (`[-180, 75, 80]`): long tree shadows across the player view, but a fresh
  judge rejected it (meadow 5 → 4.5, player 5 → 4.5): ~26% darker, a hard-edged sun disc in frame and
  no warm light.

The same judge scores the kept state 5/10 on the meadow and player views. The gap to the reference is
light shafts, dappled sun and bright back-lit air, which none of these constant changes produce; the
next lane needs a volumetric or height-fog light term and a sun disc with bloom, not more rebalancing.

Kept: the TRAA silhouette stair-steps came from the air composite's one-pixel depth dilation, written
for MSAA; on the single-sampled TRAA path it painted surface air along every edge against the sky.
Plain depth on that path raises the share of intermediate pixels on the crown/sky boundary from 0.392
to 0.501 (MSAA reference 0.478), 0 console errors.

Rejected: GTAO radius 0.85 → 2 m in the forest brightened the meadow (81.0 → 87.3) and added no
visible trunk-contact darkening. Trunk grounding needs a dedicated contact term (for example a
per-trunk ground decal or screen-space contact shadow), not a wider GTAO.

Rejected, with the working recipe kept here: a forest `godRays` stage marching the coarse
`VirtualShadowNode` level. It needs two engine lines, both verified (132/132 shadow specs, chain
applied, 0 console errors): `levelLights` must call `#init()` (the chain builds before any material
has built the levels, so the stage was dropped as "levels are not built yet"), and `LevelLight` must
declare `isDirectionalLight = true` (otherwise `GodraysNode` throws "Unsupported light type").
Density 0.4 fogged the player view (meadow 61 → 116, sky 186 → 216); density 0.12 with a 0.12 floor
and the sky masked left the meadow unchanged (81.0 → 83.1) and washed the distant hills beige. Neither
camera looks into the sun through gaps, so the stage adds haze, not shafts. A `bloom` stage (0.12,
radius 0.4, threshold 0.9) changed nothing visible without the sun in frame.

Readiness on this shared host, page start to `worldReady`, same build, alternated arms: authored
crown normals 82.4 s and 67.0 s, radial 111.3 s and 56.7 s (load 26–42). The spread is host load, not
the crown-normal mode, so the `terrain.playtest.json` first step (60 s) stays red here for an
environmental reason; thresholds are unchanged. A quiet-host rerun or the streaming lane's loading
work is what can turn it green.

Kept: forest haze density 0.00055 → 0.0011 per metre (only `temperate`, which every other world
overrides). The far band of the elevated view moves 119 → 137 luma into the sky's blue-grey; a fresh
judge scored that view 5 → 6 ("real aerial perspective at range with no cost up close"), the meadow
unchanged at 6 ([capture](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/forest-haze-player.jpg)).
Remaining named causes: repeated noise texture on the far hills and uniform tree shapes.

Quieter host (load 9–17): the unchanged `terrain.playtest.json` still fails its first step
(`worldReady` > 60 s). Readiness from navigation, alternated: TRAA 58.1 s and 50.1 s, `?off=traa`
68.8 s and 45.4 s, so the forest TRAA change adds no load time. The 60 s step leaves no headroom over
45–69 s readiness plus runner overhead; this belongs to the loading lane, and the threshold stays.

Native desktop (fresh `pnpm native:build`, 1:46, same tree): `test:terrain:desktop` passes the forest
and coastal phases with this session's commits, then fails at `alpine-ground-ready`
(`groundBiome` stays `"baked"` for 15 s). The same scenario on the pre-session versions of every
file this session changed (`de1b57ab9`) fails at the same step and timeout, so the alpine native
ground load predates this work; the shared `VirtualShadowNode` fix does not regress native.

**Native desktop draws no ground textures (pre-existing, found 2026-10-08).** With the swallowed
errors logged, every world's ground material fails on the native host: `RangeError: Ground layer
'grass' has no diffuse texture`, because every ground map is `TN_ASSETS_UNRESOLVED` (for example
`leafy_grass/leafy_grass_diff_1k.jpg`, `temperate/rockface/diffuse.ktx2`): the host looks only at
`<path>` and `assets/<path>` beside the example, while the web build serves them from Vite's
`publicDir` (`packages/terrain/starter-assets`) and dev-server mounts of `local-assets/`. Forest and
coastal desktop phases pass only because they never assert `groundBiome`; the terrain renders on its
flat placeholder colours. Two `.catch(() => undefined)` calls in `terrain.ts` (`get()` and the
ground-material chain) hide this, against the fail-closed rule. Fix belongs to the native lane: give
the native run one asset root (or the `assets/` convention) covering all three sources, then make
the ground-material failure throw.

Native ground textures fixed in the example: `test:terrain:desktop` now runs
`scripts/stage-native-assets.mjs`, which hard-links the CC0 `packages/terrain/starter-assets` set
(65 files) into a gitignored `assets/`, the path the native host searches. Red → green on the same
fresh native host: `alpine-ground-ready` timed out with `groundBiome` stuck at `"baked"` before;
after, every phase runs, the ground draws its grass and rock maps
([capture](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/native-ground-staged-meadow.jpg)) and the run
logs 0 console errors. Staging the licensed `local-assets/` roots as well was tried and rejected: the
cooked KTX2 spruce then loaded untextured (blue-white cards, 143 `GLTFLoader: Couldn't load texture
../shared/images/*.ktx2` errors), worse than the procedural fallback; native KTX2 decoding is the
native lane's follow-up. The desktop scenario still fails 22 of 62 assertions, mostly web-only
measurements the native target cannot provide (Long Tasks, GPU timestamp windows, budget windows),
plus `props.crags.drawn` and `player.visible` at two steps; these were unreachable before.

Native KTX2 follow-up, located: the licensed models' textures failed because the KTX2 loader looks for
its Basis transcoder at `basis/` beside the game, where the native `assets/` fallback does not apply.
With the transcoder also linked at `basis/`, decoding proceeds and the run then loses the device in
the PR's bounded compressed upload: `TN_STRATA_SPAWN_FAILURE … "Device lost during texture
preparation."` at 21.7 s on the forest. Native KTX2 therefore needs (1) the transcoder resolved
through the same asset root and (2) a native fix in `prepareTextureAsync`; both belong to the native
lane. The shipped staging stays public-only.

Native upload-loss narrowing (code reading, not yet traced): the native host maps every BC format and
requests `texture-compression-bc`; V8's `getArrayBufferData` honours a typed array's `byteOffset`; and
the JS `device.lost` promise is never settled by the native host (`__mystral_device_lost_resolve` has
no caller), while a real Dawn loss goes to the fatal `reportFatalDeviceLoss`. So the upload's
`device.lost.then(lost, lost)` should not fire on native; the next step is a traced native run
(verbose WebGPU logging) to see which call precedes the loss. Separately, the native `writeTexture`
binding applies `dataLayout.offset` twice (pointer arithmetic and `layout.offset`); the bounded upload
passes 0, so it is latent, but any non-zero offset reads past the intended bytes.

### 2026-10-08 — independent diagnosis of the persistent look, and three fixes

An independent diagnostic pass (in-page A/B on the forest meadow, RTX 2080) ranked the causes:

1. **The vegetation envMap carries an unshadowed second sun.** `kloofendal_48d_2k.hdr` (`pack.ts`,
   `propMaterials.ts` `skyEnvironment`, 1.13) holds a 72,559-luminance sun disc 81° from the scene
   sun; clamped out in-page, meadow linear light falls 0.1258 → 0.0700. Linear meadow budget: real sun
   14%, HDR sun 44%, HDR sky 36%, hemisphere 6%. The ground receives no env light at all. **Fixed** in
   `d5bef2ff9`: `loadSkyLight` caps texel luminance at 30 and forest exposure rises to `2 ** 0.87`; a
   fresh judge scored the meadow 5.0 → 6.0 and the elevated view 4.5 → 5.5 (strong tree shadows, lit
   crown side, 0.02% clipped) ([meadow](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/sky-sun-clamped-meadow.jpg),
   [elevated](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/sky-sun-clamped-player.jpg)). Ground env
   light is still absent.
2. **TRAA let the auto scaler fall to 0.23** (442×248 on 1920×1080): core lifted the desktop floor for
   any velocity consumer. **Fixed** in `4ad7d9750`: same host, buffer now 1171×659 (the 0.61 floor).
3. **Canvas alpha leak**: cutout coverage alpha reached the alpha canvas; 13.4% of meadow pixels took a
   magenta page tint. **Fixed** in `c1c7f0b72` (grade writes alpha 1): 0.14%.
4. **Imported normal maps lost their glTF green flip** (`normalScale` not copied). **Fixed** in
   `e60883bd3`, with DirectX-authored maps (spruce branch, LargePlainsBoulder002,
   Large_VolcanicRock_002, ScotsPine_01_*) kept unflipped per a curl test on the staged maps.
5. ACES crushes the dark crowns (15.0% below 0.08 vs AgX 8.4% at matched brightness). **Tried, kept
   ACES.** In-page A/B at the same exposure: AgX lifted the crowns (near-black 24.3% → 8.3%) but a fresh
   judge read it as washed teal-grey (3/10 vs ACES 4.5); Neutral at +0.3 EV opened the crowns (18.6%) but
   blew out the cloud cores, turned the sky cartoon cyan and darkened the meadow (66 vs 77), judged 4 vs
   4.5 on the meadow. The crown gain has to come from canopy fill light, not the tone curve.
6. GTAO multiplies direct sun and haze (`sky.ts`); AO off raises meadow 12%, crowns 15%. **Open.**
7. Imported foliage had no transmission, so backlit grass got 14% of its light from the real sun.
   **Fixed** in the commit after `2cca8e2e9`: forest ground foliage (`importedFoliage` path) adds the
   shadowed `lightNeedles` backlight at 0.6 without its crown fill. Backlit meadow 77.4 → 92.0, the
   non-backlit elevated view unchanged; fresh judge 4 → 5/10 (mid meadow believable; near field
   lifts the gaps too). The earlier "grass transmission had no effect" round edited `cutoutSurface`,
   which alpha-tested grass never reaches, so it was a no-op, not a measurement.
   ([capture](../../benchmark/strata-loading-2026-10-06/foliage-transmission-meadow.jpg)) 8. (Suspected) mid/far terrain detail is replaced by flat colour beyond 32–115 m.

Corrections to earlier sections: the kept field-grass root lift (`fe6964fc8`) edits a branch the
alpha-tested grass never reaches, so its reported gain was run-to-run variance; single captures taken
30 s after a view switch are confounded by streaming (the meadow moved 79.9 → 97.0 between 30 s and
90 s); and the "29% residual" was measured on tone-mapped values (≈0 in linear light on the near meadow).
Judged captures before `4ad7d9750` rendered below full resolution (a spectrum fit puts them near 0.85).

No box changes. Computed progress remains **50%: 2/4 phases, 7/13 phase boxes**.
