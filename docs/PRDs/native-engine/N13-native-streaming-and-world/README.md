# N13 — Native streaming and world systems

**Status:** PROPOSED — umbrella for PRD-520 … PRD-522; the boxes live in the child PRDs.

The work package must prove that a streamed world loads, walks and unloads on the native host with no TypeScript engine implementation behind it (§11.3). Streaming admission stays inside a per-frame budget. Failures and recovery are visible. Repeated bounded load/unload cycles show no sustained memory growth (§15.4). Today's systems are `packages/core/src/streaming.ts`, `world-cells.ts`, `world-tiles.ts`, `world-gpu-scene.ts`, `world-package.ts` and `world.ts`. Their baseline record is the Machinefall entry in `docs/verification/runtime-perf-state.md` (§3 R4).
