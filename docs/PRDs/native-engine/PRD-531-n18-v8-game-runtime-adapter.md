# PRD-531 — V8 game runtime adapter (N18)

**Status:** PROPOSED
**Complexity:** 4 — the first shipping game runtime over the C++ engine; lifetime and crossing cost are the hard parts
**Owner:** João
**Work package:** N18 — [native-engine batch](README.md)
**Depends on:** [PRD-500 (N03)](PRD-500-n03-api-catalog-binding-abi-and-version-protocol.md), [N04 — lifetime and numerics](N04-lifetime-and-numerics/README.md), [PRD-508 (N06)](PRD-508-n06-native-scene-graph-transforms-cameras-geometry.md); Phase 3 also needs [PRD-514 (N09)](PRD-514-n09-native-renderer-and-standard-materials.md)

## Context

Owner decision 2 ([PRD-497](PRD-497-n00-architecture-decision-and-compatibility-inventory.md)) makes this the first product: game TypeScript keeps running on the V8 that desktop and Android already ship (`packages/runtime-native/src/js/v8_engine.cpp`; Android defaults to V8 since PRD-130). The engine underneath it is C++. §2.1 still applies: the adapter brings no JavaScript implementation of animation, traversal, batching or materials, so the engine stays JS-free (decision 1) while the game is not yet (gate T is later). §8.2 forbids carrying 64-bit handles as plain JS numbers. §7.1 requires the adapter to take part in the lifetime protocol: callbacks that capture wrappers form cross-language cycles, and rooting them forever is not acceptable.

The CP1 checkpoint ([PRD-534](PRD-534-cp1-the-native-engine-earns-the-port.md)) measures through this adapter, because the speed claim has to hold with game code on V8.

## Solution

1. **One generator, several VMs** (decision 8). A catalog-driven generator (proposed: `packages/three-native/generator/`) emits per-VM binding code. This PRD ships the V8 back end into proposed `packages/runtime-native/src/adapters/v8/`. N19 adds the browser-JS-over-Wasm back end; JSC follows when iOS returns. Wrappers adapt names, overloads and lifetimes, and implement no engine algorithm (§8.3).
2. **Imports resolve to the bindings.** `three`, `three/webgpu` and `three/tsl` in a game resolve to generated stubs over the engine when the engine profile is `native`. Constructors keep one identity across entry points (§2.2).
3. Handles live in V8 internal fields, never in a JS number.
4. Wrappers and captured callbacks register as roots and edges with the N04c reachability layer, so a cycle through JS and native objects is reclaimed at a safe point.
5. **Crossing cost is measured, not guessed** (decision 9). A micro-benchmark counts the cost of a property write and a method call through the adapter. Bulk typed-array paths are added only where CP1 attributes frame time to crossings.
6. The adapter is its own build target; no engine target includes V8 headers (§13). Telemetry and crash reports name the game runtime (§17).
7. Rollback: the legacy engine profile stays selectable until [PRD-535 (N21)](PRD-535-n21-the-js-engine-is-deleted.md) deletes it.

## Out of scope

- The browser-JS back end ([PRD-532](PRD-532-n19-webassembly-native-core-browser-port.md)). The AOT game runtime ([N05](N05-native-typescript-qualification/README.md)).

## Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: Generated bindings
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** proposed `packages/three-native/generator/`, `packages/runtime-native/src/adapters/v8/`, `packages/runtime-native/tests/native-engine/v8_*.cpp`
- [ ] The V8 back end covers every catalog entry marked supported, and nothing else. proof: `ctest --test-dir packages/runtime-native/build/tn-linux -R native_engine_v8_catalog_coverage`
- [ ] A handle round-trips through JS without losing bits. proof: `ctest --test-dir packages/runtime-native/build/tn-linux -R native_engine_v8_handles`
- [ ] Every engine target below the adapter has no V8 include or link. proof: `node packages/runtime-native/scripts/inspect-js-free.mjs --binary <each engine target>`

#### Phase 2: Same engine, same lifetime
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** proposed `packages/runtime-native/src/adapters/v8/lifetime.cpp`
- [ ] A JS-to-native cycle through a captured callback is reclaimed at a safe point. proof: `ctest --test-dir packages/runtime-native/build/tn-linux -R native_engine_v8_cycle_reclaim`
- [ ] Repeated whole-runtime create and destroy shows no native object or GPU resource growth. proof: `ctest --test-dir packages/runtime-native/build/tn-linux -R native_engine_v8_runtime_churn`
- [ ] The N06 scene-semantics fixtures pass through the V8 adapter with the same results as the C++ driver. proof: `ctest --test-dir packages/runtime-native/build/tn-linux -R native_engine_v8_scene_fixtures`

#### Phase 3: A game runs on it
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** `packages/create-threenative/` (engine profile resolution)
- [ ] Per-call cost of a property write and a method call through the adapter is reported. proof: `ctest --test-dir packages/runtime-native/build/tn-linux -R native_engine_v8_crossing_bench`
- [ ] The minimal template, unchanged, runs its playtest journey on the native engine profile on desktop. proof: `node packages/playtest/dist/runner/cli.js <minimal journey>.playtest.json --target desktop`

## Decisions

- This game runtime is the default until gate T ships, and it is never called a JS-free *application* (§2.1). The engine under it is JS-free (owner, 2026-10-04).
