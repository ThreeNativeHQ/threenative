# N11 — Native animation, morphs and skinning

**Status:** PROPOSED — umbrella for PRD-516 … PRD-518; the boxes live in the child PRDs.

**Gate:** no child PRD here starts until [PRD-534 (CP1)](../PRD-534-cp1-the-native-engine-earns-the-port.md) passes (owner decision 3, 2026-10-04).

The work package must prove the supported `AnimationMixer` semantics running natively (§11.2): pose parity with the pinned reference, event ordering, morph targets and non-skeletal property tracks, and skinning palettes with previous-pose history for motion vectors. Animation update frequency is verified separately from render-pass frequency. An explicitly updated mixer is never evaluated a second time by engine scheduling (§6.4).

ozz-animation is a later, measured option for packed skeletal workloads (§11.2). It is not scheduled here: it gets its own PRD only when a physical-device profile shows the exact evaluator is the bottleneck, and it must pass the same pose and time tests.
