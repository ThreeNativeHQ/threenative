# N05 — Native TypeScript compiler qualification

**Status:** PROPOSED — early spike, not on the promotion path. Children carry the boxes; this file has none.

**Owner decision 2 (2026-10-04, [PRD-497](../PRD-497-n00-architecture-decision-and-compatibility-inventory.md)):** game code ships on V8 first ([PRD-531 (N18)](../PRD-531-n18-v8-game-runtime-adapter.md)), and gate T is a later milestone. N05 still runs early, because the answer is cheap and informs the catalog and lifetime design. A failed corpus blocks gate T only. It never blocks N06–N16, N18–N20 or [CP1](../PRD-534-cp1-the-native-engine-earns-the-port.md).

N05 decides whether gate **T** (§1) is reachable before the engine rewrite widens. It must show one
Three-shaped TypeScript fixture, written against the familiar `three`, `three/webgpu` and
`three/tsl` imports, compiled ahead of time by a pinned Perry (decision 11; TypeScriptCompiler was dropped 2026-10-05) and running natively on
Linux x64 and Android arm64, with a proven rooting/reclamation path for callbacks that capture
engine wrappers (§7.1, §8.4). If the agreed corpus needs a broad compiler or runtime redesign, the
stop rule in [PRD-505](PRD-505-n05a-the-language-corpus-compiles-on-linux-x64.md#decisions) applies.
