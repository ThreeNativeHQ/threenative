# PRD-507 — The same corpus runs on Android arm64 (N05c)

**Status:** PROPOSED — early spike for gate T; blocks nothing else (owner decision 2)
**Complexity:** 4 — cross-compilation, NDK linking and packaging for a third-party compiler runtime
**Owner:** João
**Work package:** N05 — [native-engine batch](../README.md) · [N05 index](README.md)
**Depends on:** [PRD-505](PRD-505-n05a-the-language-corpus-compiles-on-linux-x64.md); the `three-fixture` and callback cases from [PRD-506](PRD-506-n05b-three-imports-bind-natively-and-callbacks-are-reclaimed.md) join once they exist

## Context

§8.4 requires the corpus on Linux x64 **and** Android arm64 early: an LLVM target triple does not
establish a working runtime, linker, standard library, ABI or packaging path. §18 lists "device
path differs from desktop" as a stop risk. The repository already builds the native host for
Android through the NDK and Gradle (`packages/runtime-native/android/`, build tree
`packages/runtime-native/build/tn-android`) and packages 16 KB-aligned libraries
(`pnpm native:verify:android:artifact`). The compiler's GC runtime (Boehm, PRD-505 decision) must
link into that same shape.

## Solution

1. Cross-compile each corpus case for `aarch64-linux-android` with the pinned toolchain plus the
   repository's pinned NDK; link the compiler's runtime and GC statically into one `.so` per case.
2. Run each case two ways: as a standalone executable pushed with `adb` (fast loop), and loaded by
   a minimal Android activity from the existing host's packaging path (the real shape).
3. 16 KB page alignment is checked on every produced library with the existing verifier.
4. Same expected stdout files as Linux x64 — no Android-specific expectations.

## Out of scope

- Strict game APK packaging and artifact manifests — [PRD-530 (N17)](../PRD-530-n17-strict-native-typescript-game-packaging.md).
- Device performance claims — [PRD-533 (N20)](../PRD-533-n20-platform-qualification-performance-default-promotion.md).

## Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: Cross-compile and link
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** proposed `tools/native-typescript/targets/android-arm64.json`
- [ ] Every corpus case links for `aarch64-linux-android` with the pinned NDK and GC runtime. proof: `node tools/native-typescript/run-corpus.mjs --native --target aarch64-linux-android --build-only` — open; re-prove with Perry, which targets Android (decision 11). tslang history, 2026-10-05: 11 of 16 cases link (`--target aarch64-linux-android --build-only`, NDK r28c 28.2.13676358 from `targets/android-arm64.json`, Boehm GC 8.2.12 cross-built for arm64 and linked into each library); `unsupported-export` refuses as on x86. Two walls keep it open: the 4 three-importing cases need the engine libraries (`tn_engine_abi`, `tn_engine_animation`) built for arm64, which no build produces yet; and every library still leaves the compiler's own runtime (`console.log`, number formatting) undefined, because the pinned tslang segfaults (exit 139) compiling its shipped `defaultlib/lib.ts` for any triple — the same crash as PRD-506's box, an owner decision on the toolchain pin or a fork.
- [ ] Every produced library passes 16 KB alignment. proof: `node packages/runtime-native/scripts/check-android-16kb-alignment.mjs <corpus-out>/android` — **reopened 2026-10-05: proven with tslang, which decision 11 drops for Perry; re-prove with Perry.** tslang history: 2026-10-05: all 11 libraries the cross build produces pass (`check-android-16kb-alignment.mjs artifacts/native-typescript/android`, which now takes a directory of ELF files; every LOAD segment 0x4000). Red control: the same link on the NDK 27.1 driver without `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384` gives 0x1000 segments and the check fails; r28c already defaults to 16 KB. The spec suite stays green (`android-16kb-alignment.test.mjs` 37 passed, `tools/native-typescript` 17 passed).

#### Phase 2: Run on the emulator
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** proposed `tools/native-typescript/run-corpus.mjs` (adb runner)
- [ ] Every case's stdout and exit code on an arm64 Android emulator match the Linux reference. proof: `node tools/native-typescript/run-corpus.mjs --native --target aarch64-linux-android --adb <emulator-serial>`
- [ ] The `three-fixture` case runs inside the host's packaged activity, not only as a pushed executable. proof: `node tools/native-typescript/run-corpus.mjs --native --target aarch64-linux-android --case three-fixture --packaged`

## Blocked on

- Physical arm64 confirmation of the same run (§2.3 names physical Android hardware as a primary target) — João attaches the Pixel 8.
