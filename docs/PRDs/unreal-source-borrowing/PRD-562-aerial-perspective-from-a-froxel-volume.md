# PRD-562 — Distant land takes the colour of the sky it is seen through

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Priority:** P2 — AC-1 to AC-3 are open: `Atmosphere.aerialPerspective` mixes every pixel toward one zenith colour, and no template uses the atmosphere at all.
**Complexity:** 4 (MEDIUM) — 1–5 implementation files (1), a new GPU resource with per-frame view-space state (+2), template adoption (+1); risk override: none
**Owner:** João
**Depends on:** None. Builds on the LUT stack that [PRD-248](../done/PRD-248-the-atmosphere-is-luts-the-sky-is-the-games.md) shipped. Composes with [PRD-560](./PRD-560-height-fog-follows-the-ground.md) height fog: this PRD is kilometre-scale air, and PRD-560 is ground mist.

## Context

`packages/core/src/atmosphere/` already builds the Hillaire-style LUTs: transmittance 256×64,
multi-scattering 32×32 and sky-view 192×108 (`luts.ts:34-37`). Its aerial-perspective method
(`index.ts:233-253`) does not use them for the haze:

- The haze amount is `1 - exp(-distanceKm × extinction)`, where `extinction` is one scalar, the mean
  of the Rayleigh and Mie coefficients. It is clamped at 0.98.
- The haze colour is one sample, `radiance(vec3(0, 1, 0))`, the zenith, unless the game passes its own.
  So distant land toward the sun and away from the sun hazes to the same colour. A low sun does not
  warm the far hills, and a looking-down view hazes like a looking-up view.

No template or example constructs `Atmosphere` (`rg "new Atmosphere\("` outside tests and the
capability manifest, 2026-10-09). The starter mist disables aerial perspective while it lives
(`templates/starter/src/render/volumetricFog.ts:54`). [PRD-VQ-07](../done/PRD-VQ-07-volumetric-fog.md)
deliberately shipped "no mandatory froxel engine" for local mist. This PRD adds one small
view-space volume for atmosphere-scale haze only. It is not a general volumetric-fog grid.

### What Unreal does (UE 5.8.3, read 2026-10-09)

- **A camera-aligned 3D volume holds in-scattered light (RGB) and transmittance (A).** The defaults
  are 32×32 texels across the screen, 16 depth slices over 96 km, and at most 2 ray-march samples per
  slice. `UE 5.8.3: Engine/Source/Runtime/Renderer/Private/SkyAtmosphereRendering.cpp:180-196`.
- **The slices are spaced by the square root of distance,** so near slices are thin and far slices
  are thick. A lookup converts linear depth to a slice coordinate with `sqrt`.
  `UE 5.8.3: Engine/Shaders/Private/SkyAtmosphereCommon.ush:66-71`.
- **Near the camera, the contribution fades to zero** under the first half slice, and over a near
  fade range, so the camera's own position is never hazed.
  `UE 5.8.3: Engine/Shaders/Private/SkyAtmosphereCommon.ush:74-81`.
- **The apply step is one trilinear 3D fetch per pixel.** Colour scales by the fade weight, and
  alpha keeps the transmittance consistent.
  `UE 5.8.3: Engine/Shaders/Private/SkyAtmosphereCommon.ush:104-108`.
- **Scalability:** the lowest effects tier uses 8 slices and 1 sample per slice. The next tier uses
  16 slices. `UE 5.8.3: Engine/Config/BaseScalability.ini:812-814, 841-843`.

## Solution

**The volume is mechanism. The look stays the game's.**

- `Atmosphere` gains the volume as a compute pass that it owns, beside its LUTs:
  - The texture is a 32×32×N `rgba16float` storage 3D texture, where N is 16, or 8 at the `low`
    tier.
  - Each texel integrates in-scatter and transmittance along its view ray, from the camera to its
    slice depth, using the existing transmittance and multi-scattering LUTs. The sun direction is the
    one the game already passes.
  - The pass runs once per frame, because the volume follows the view.
- **Auto by default:** the volume's depth range comes from the camera's `far`, so a game sets no
  depth constant. A named `aerialPerspectiveDepth` override exists, and `TN_ATMOSPHERE` reports the
  depth it used and where the value came from.
- `aerialPerspective(scenePass, depth, inScatteredRadiance?)` keeps its signature. Its body samples
  the volume with the square-root slice mapping and the near fade. The single-zenith-sample body is
  deleted, because no template or example consumes it. The optional `inScatteredRadiance` now
  scales the volume's in-scatter instead of replacing it. It stays the game's tint and exposure hook,
  so the package still decides no colour.
- **First consumer: the racing template.** Its `FogExp2` density 0.0024 is the lowest of the
  templates, so it has the longest view. The racing template keeps its photographed sky and
  background. It adds an `Atmosphere` for the haze only, in its own `src/render/sky.ts` and
  `postprocessing.ts`, tinted toward the photograph's horizon through `inScatteredRadiance`. Slice count
  and tint per tier live in its `quality.ts`.

Risks:

- three's compute path must write a 3D storage texture on WebGPU and on the native host. Phase 3
  proves the native side.
- Double haze with PRD-560 height fog. The racing template calibrates both against one judged
  capture, and neither term is removed silently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1 [local]: The racing frame with volume aerial perspective is judged at or above the current photographed-sky `FogExp2` frame, and far terrain toward a low sun reads warmer than far terrain away from it. proof: `pnpm visuals:ab --before <current racing> --after <volume AP racing> --raters 3` — Evidence: pending.
- [ ] AC-2 [local]: The volume compute and apply cost at most 0.3 ms GPU together at 1080p on the RTX 2080 browser WebGPU lane. proof: `TN_FRAME_BUDGET` p50 delta from `node packages/playtest/dist/runner/cli.js perf`, aerial perspective on against off — Evidence: pending.
- [ ] AC-3 [local]: On the Pixel 8 at the `low` tier (8 slices), they cost at most 0.5 ms GPU. proof: `node packages/playtest/dist/runner/cli.js perf --logcat <serial>`, on against off — Evidence: pending.

## Integration Ledger

| Capability | Reachable consumer/trigger | Replaces / disposition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aerial-perspective volume | racing `src/render/postprocessing.ts` → `atmosphere.aerialPerspective(scenePass, depth)` → volume compute + 3D fetch | Replaces the single-zenith-sample body of `index.ts:233-253`, which no game consumes | Phase 1, AC-1 |

## Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: The volume in the core atmosphere
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** `packages/core/src/atmosphere/index.ts`, `packages/core/src/atmosphere/luts.ts`, `packages/core/__tests__/atmosphere.spec.ts`
- [ ] The slice mapping round-trips depth to slice coordinate and back within 0.1% across the depth range. The near fade is 0 at the camera and 1 past the first half slice. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/atmosphere.spec.ts`.
- [ ] The volume is created as 32×32×16 `rgba16float` (8 slices at `low`), its depth follows `camera.far` unless overridden, and `TN_ATMOSPHERE` reports both values. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/atmosphere.spec.ts`.

#### Phase 2: Racing adopts it
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** `templates/racing/src/render/sky.ts`, `templates/racing/src/render/postprocessing.ts`, `templates/racing/src/render/quality.ts`, `templates/racing/AGENTS.md` (and mirror)
- [ ] The racing template renders volume aerial perspective over its photographed sky, and the template gate passes. proof: `pnpm test:templates` (racing).

#### Phase 3: Native
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Files:** `packages/runtime-native/conformance/scenes/shared/aerial-perspective.js` (new), `packages/runtime-native/conformance/registry.json`
- [ ] The desktop native host fills the volume to match the browser reference within tolerance for a fixed camera and sun. proof: `pnpm parity --target desktop --only-tests aerial-perspective`.
