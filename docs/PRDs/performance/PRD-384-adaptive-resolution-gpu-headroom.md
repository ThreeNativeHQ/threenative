# PRD-384 — Adaptive resolution must distinguish host delay from GPU cost

**Status:** PARTIAL
**Complexity:** 5 (MEDIUM); risk override: none
**Owner:** Codex
**Depends on:** PRD-228; Midway's installed PRD-382 engine branch

## Context and solution

Midway's live NVIDIA Turing capture fell from 1920×1080 to 998×562 after 60 seconds.
Reported GPU samples were 6.8–7.74 ms while presentation stayed around 9 fps. Shrinking
73% of pixels gained about 2.5% fps. The user requires automatic optimization, so pinning
`renderer.resolutionScale: 1` is rejected. Original observations live in the game's
`docs/blur-investigation.md` and local `screenshots/blur-before/samples.json`.

Repair the existing `packages/core/src/resolution-scaler.ts`, reached by `game.ts`'s
frame-budget callback. Existing frame windows already supply `gpuMs` and `gpuAgeFrames`.
No new public API, renderer, platform-specific game code or gameplay change.
Capability discovery returned no scaler capability; `defineGame` supplies the existing
`render.resolutionScale` option. Keep automatic policy and honest surface reporting.

Before implementation, register this policy:

1. A finite positive GPU sample with integer age 0–8 Three frame IDs is usable. Eight is
   an explicit asynchronous-query allowance, not a percentile claim (observed ages 3, 7, 4).
   Missing, invalid or older data retains the existing presentation fallback.
2. A fresh GPU sample within the current target budget vetoes a down-step. GPU overload
   sizes the drop from GPU cost, not the host's FPS deficit. Existing presentation, startup,
   stall and resize guards remain.
3. Four eligible windows whose projected next-rung GPU cost fits the budget recover one
   rung even when host FPS is low. Project using the actual squared scale ratio. Unknown
   GPU timing retains the existing FPS/tail recovery criteria.
4. Oscillation inhibits upward probes for six windows (the existing oscillation reach),
   rather than permanently freezing the controller. Overload can still lower resolution.
   Expiry reports `auto` even when the scale itself does not change.

`gpuMs` is one resolved sample, not a window percentile; sustained recovery and the existing
guards bound that limitation. Timestamp aggregation and empirical workload rollback are outside
this repair. No claim is made to fix host scheduling or the game's overall frame rate.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] AC-1 [local; actor: agent]: Fresh GPU headroom preserves/reclaims pixels under low FPS;
  GPU overload still scales proportionately; unavailable/stale timing preserves fallback.
  Focused Vitest run: 57 tests passed in six scaler/frame-budget suites. Red: the new GPU suite
  had five behavior failures (including 0.23 instead of 1, and 0.52 instead of 0.85).
  Broader component verification: all 1,224 core tests passed (24.97 seconds).
- [x] AC-2 [local; actor: agent]: Oscillation expires, reports its actual source and permits
  subsequent overload response; existing vsync/outlier regressions pass.
  Same run as AC-1; covers expiry source propagation and overload during the temporary hold.
- [x] AC-3 [local; actor: agent]: Repacked core runs Midway with `auto`, passing a live flight
  and camera-switch resolution check on the named GPU, with inspected frames.
  Midway SBD: 90 seconds, nine C-key presses, 19 samples at 1920×1080, source `auto`, no browser
  errors; end frame inspected. Tarball: `threenative-core-0.3.2-gpu-headroom-6367d7456bd5.tgz`.
  Engine and game typechecks and the game web build pass. Baseline and after frames/timings are
  recorded in the game's investigation; the capture rig does not establish a 60-fps target.
  Devastator: the same 90-second capture also passed, with 19 full-resolution `auto` samples,
  nine C-key presses and no browser errors; cockpit and final chase frames inspected.
- [ ] AC-4 [local; actor: agent]: Typecheck, lint and test run; native controller execution
  and fresh independent review cover the changed behavior. Report unrelated failures explicitly.
  Native controller fixture ran on the installed Linux runtime with exit 0 and
  `TN_SCALER_NATIVE_PASS`. This proves controller behavior, not a native Midway launch.
  Independent read-only review passed; its age-8 boundary request was added and passed.
  Whole-engine `pnpm test` reached native package tests: 18 failures from absent native build
  artifacts, 1,029 passed, 62 skipped. Whole-engine lint reports pre-existing water-surface
  formatting and ripple-field non-null assertions. Changed files pass Biome's error checks.
  These unrelated full-suite prerequisites remain open; no full green or merge is claimed.

## Integration

`defineGame` → `game.ts` frame budget `onWindow` → `ResolutionScaler.observe` →
`renderer.setResolutionScale`; numeric pin overrides and frame-budget output remain intact.
Game adoption uses a content-hashed core tarball, never node_modules edits.

### Phase 1 — Engine behavior

- [x] Reproduce with regression tests; implement and pass the focused scaler/integration tests.
- [x] Update template guidance and pass independent review of the implementation.

### Phase 2 — Consumer verification

- [x] Run required engine checks and native controller proof; pack the compatible core.
- [x] Reinstall in Midway, run automatic-scale flight captures, inspect images and update its note.

## Checkout

Owner: this Codex task. Checkout: `/home/joao/projects/threenative/threenative-engine/.worktrees/blur-scaler`.
Branch: `fix/blur-scaler`. Base: `be0d68b3ba06d8c1732337f788d7e00c17ae00a4`, the exact
source of Midway's installed core; develop lacks its flight/water/shadow fixes. The repair is
kept separate from those existing changes. The baseline index exports `ripple-field.ts`, but
that file is untracked in the primary checkout; an unchanged copy was required for the isolated
build and is excluded from this repair's commit. Cleanup: complete. The task commit was
cherry-picked to the primary engine checkout with an identical Git tree. After verifying the
owner had stopped, releasing its lease and auditing tracked, untracked and ignored data, the
baseline source copy and gate status were preserved in `/tmp/midway-scaler-*`. Ordinary
`git worktree remove` removed the 2.4G checkout; its directory and registration are gone.
The game adoption is included in `5a59e49` on `midway/asset-battle-integration`.
