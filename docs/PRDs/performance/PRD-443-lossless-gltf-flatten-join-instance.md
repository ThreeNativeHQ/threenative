# PRD-443 — Lossless flatten/join/instance pass for `@threenative/assets` model pipeline

**Status:** PARTIAL (Phases 1–3 done and verified; Phase 4's engine-side release is done and its Midway boxes are recorded, with the `run-handoff.sh` box blocked by Midway's own red gates — see Phase 4)
**Complexity:** 6 (MEDIUM); risk override: none
**Owner:** Joao Furtado
**Depends on:** None

## Context

Native Midway (`sandbox/midway-open-pacific`) is CPU-bound, not GPU-bound (GPU 8-23% busy). The
per-frame cost is per-node (matrix pass) and per-draw (~9,900 scene nodes, ~400 draws/frame across
main+shadow+reflection). `AGENTS.md`'s standing instruction: an abstraction the game needs belongs
in the engine.

`@threenative/assets` (`packages/assets/src/passes/model.ts`) already runs `dedup → prune → simplify
→ reorder → quantize` (verified: `compileModel`'s pass order comment, line 81; `dedup`/`prune`/
`quantize`/`simplify` imports, lines 16-22). It has no `flatten` or `instance` pass, and no `join`
either — the CLI's own `join` command implicitly runs `dedup`+`flatten` first but the engine
pipeline never calls it.

**Whether Midway's shipped GLBs pass through this pipeline at all — verified, they do not.**
`midway-open-pacific/threenative.config.ts` has no `assets` key, so `assets.models` is unset.
`watchAssets()` (`packages/assets/src/watch.ts:80`) resolves its source root from
`options.config?.source ?? DEFAULT_SOURCE`, and Midway has no source `assets/` directory (only
`public/assets/`, which Vite copies byte-for-byte — see the `vite-build-copies-assets-into-public`
project lesson). The 29 GLBs in `public/assets/` are produced entirely by
`tools/import-fleet.sh` / `tools/import-aircraft.sh` / `tools/blender/rig-deck-crew.py`, which call
`gltf-transform weld` and `gltf-transform simplify` directly and never touch `@threenative/assets`.
So this PRD's lift has two consumers, not one: the engine's `assets.models` pass-chain (for games
that opt in) and Midway's own import scripts (which call the same new engine-exported passes
directly, since Midway's hero assets never flow through `assets.models`).

**The look is fixed.** Only lossless passes: no decimation, no re-simplification, no texture
recompression. Nodes matching Midway's `MOVING_NODE` regex (`src/render/world.ts:284`:
`propeller|aileron|rudder|flap|elevator|gear|wheel|canopy|hook|crew|gunner|threenativepivot|
torpedo|wingport|wingstarboard|cockpit controls`), animation-channel targets, skinned meshes/bones,
and any node looked up by exact name (`getObjectByName` — found 10 call sites across
`src/render/{imported-fleet,aircrew,deck-crew,imported-aircraft,devastator}.ts`, e.g. `"Head"`,
`"VINTThreeNativePivot"`, `"defaultMaterial_node_7/8"`, `"Circle008_Circle031ThreeNativePivot"`)
must survive byte-identically in structure.

Lossless dry run on **copies in `/tmp/prd443/`** (`public/assets/` untouched), `gltf-transform`
CLI, `--vertex-layout separate` throughout:

**`join` (implicitly runs `dedup`+`flatten` first) on the six files with real join headroom:**

| File | Nodes/prims before → after | Materials before → after | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| akagi.glb | 146 → 34 | 36 → 34 (2 dupes deduped) | **-77%** |
| boat.pt59.glb | 40 → 20 | 29 → 20 (9 dupes deduped) | **-50%** |
| garrison-camp.glb | 26 → 8 | 9 → 8 | **-69%** |
| radar-station.glb | 9 → 5 | 5 → 5 | **-44%** |
| hornet.glb | 94 → 75 | 75 → 75 | **-20%** |
| b25-mitchell.glb | 9 → 9 | 9 → 9 | 0% (already 1 prim/material) |
| **Sum, these 6** | **324 → 151 prims** | — | **-53%** |

**`flatten` alone on `aircraft.mitsubishi-a6m3.glb`** (244 nodes for 10 meshes — the worst
scene-graph bloat found): **244 → 15 nodes (-94%)**, mesh/material/animation counts unchanged, and
the animation channel's target node (`VINT.ThreeNativePivot`, a `MOVING_NODE`/pivot match) verified
present by name in the flattened output — `flatten` already refuses to move an animation target, no
extra protection needed for that case.

**`join` on `deck-crew.glb`** (skinned, 6 clips, 67 nodes): **unchanged** — 67 nodes, skin, all 6
anims, and `getObjectByName("Head")`'s target all survive. `join`/`flatten` already leave a rigged
hierarchy alone by design (gltf-transform's own doc note); no protection code required for skins.

**Protected-node risk — measured, not assumed.** `gltf-transform join --help` confirms
`--keepMeshes`/`--keepNamed` are booleans, not predicates: they cannot say "protect these three
named nodes, join the rest." In the `join` run above, hornet's one `MOVING_NODE`-matching node
(`..._propeller_134_0`) and akagi's rudder node *did* survive as their own primitive — but only
because each happens to hold a unique material, so `join`'s per-material grouping left them alone
by accident. A moving/looked-up node sharing a material with static hull geometry would be silently
absorbed. **Phase 2 must not ship bare CLI flags for this** — it needs an explicit protected-node
predicate (regex ∪ animation-channel targets ∪ skin joints ∪ a configurable name allow-list) applied
via the `@gltf-transform/functions` SDK before join/flatten run, not the CLI's boolean flags.

**`instance` (`EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`) — measured zero benefit on Midway's current assets.**
Ran `gltf-transform instance --min 2` on hornet, akagi, boat.pt59 (no intra-file mesh reuse found:
"No meshes with >=2 parent nodes were found") and on destroyer.samidare and the A6M3 (both refused:
"Instancing is not currently supported for animated models"). Every Midway hull/aircraft is unique
geometry per node today; `instance` earns its place in the engine for a future game with repeated
meshes (crates, foliage, formation props), not for Midway's proof, so Phase 3's AC for `instance` is
"runs, reports 0 candidates, zero regression" — the honest-report path the charter's gate rule 7
requires, not a forced win.

## Solution

Add `flatten`, `instance`, and a `join` orchestration (dedup+flatten already exist standalone; join
adds primitive-merging by material) to `@threenative/assets`'s model pass-chain, each computed
against one shared **protected-node set**: names matching a configurable regex (default seeded from
the `MOVING_NODE` shape already proven in Midway), every animation channel's target node and its
ancestors, every skin's joints, and an explicit `protectedNames` allow-list in `assets.models`. The
passes run through the gltf-transform SDK functions directly (not the CLI), so the protected set can
be checked with a real predicate instead of the CLI's boolean `--keepNamed`/`--keepMeshes`.

Default-on, named override, per the gate's convention rule: `assets.models.compact` defaults to
`{ flatten: true, join: true, instance: true }`; a game sets `assets.models.compact: false` (or
disables one sub-pass) to opt out, and the compile report says which nodes were protected and why,
and which passes ran vs. were skipped/found nothing (the `instance` "0 candidates" case above).

Two consumer paths, both real:
1. **`assets.models` pass-chain** (`packages/assets/src/passes/model.ts`) — for any game whose
   models flow through `@threenative/assets` (the intended path for new games).
2. **Midway's own import scripts** (`tools/import-fleet.sh`, `tools/import-aircraft.sh`) — since
   Midway's hero GLBs are pre-built and never touch `assets.models` (verified above), Phase 3 calls
   the same engine-exported compaction function directly from those scripts, so Midway gets the win
   without inventing a second implementation (charter rule: no second flight model, same principle).

No geometry, material, color, texture, curve, or timing argument changes — this is pure mechanism,
so it needs no look-affecting call arguments and carries no gate-2 risk.

### Phase 2 implementation notes (what the measurements changed)

- **Order is `dedup → compact → prune`**, with `compact` itself `flatten → instance → join`. The
  plan had join before instance; `dedup` first links identical meshes, and `join` merges sibling
  primitives by material, which would have destroyed exactly the shared mesh `instance` batches.
  `flatten`/`join` run with `cleanup: false` so the game-configured `prune` remains the one place
  that removes geometry, and the summary is re-measured after it.
- **`flatten` is a protected-aware reimplementation, not gltf-transform's own.** Its `flatten()`
  knows animation targets and skeleton descendants but not a game's protected names, so it
  reparented a protected pivot's mesh child, left the pivot an empty leaf, and `prune` then deleted
  it while `join` absorbed the child — a lookup the PRD forbids. The local `flattenProtected`
  leaves a node in place when it, or any ancestor, is protected, a skin joint or an animation
  target, or carries a world matrix `T * R * S` cannot represent (moving it would decompose a
  shear and the self-verify would reject the output).
- **`instance` has no predicate**, so the protected set is honoured by deep-cloning the mesh onto a
  protected node (`Mesh.clone()` copies accessors by reference, which later leaves quantize's node
  compensation unapplied — hence a true deep copy), and only when instancing is enabled. A node
  whose world matrix is not exactly `T * R * S` is detached the same way.
- **`composeTrsMatrix` is `MathUtils.compose`**, not a hand-rolled quaternion: the first cut had the
  rotation transposed, which broke `isTrsExact` for every rotated node and mis-reconstructed rotated
  instance batches.
- **The LOD join rung skips `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` nodes**, so `lod.generation.join` cannot
  collapse the placed copies onto the batch node's transform.
- **The summary and report name every removed named node**, so a `getObjectByName` the protected set
  did not cover surfaces as a build-report warning instead of a silent `undefined` at runtime.
- **`join` excludes a mesh that several nodes share** (recorded before the mesh detach). gltf-transform's own `join` would merge each repeated mesh once per node and duplicate its vertices N times — measured 13× on a 50-rivet animated prop, and animated models get no `instance` batch to absorb them. The accepted cost is one draw per repeated mesh on those models, which is already the authored state.
- **`dedup` makes Midway's repeated meshes visible to `instance`**, so akagi, garrison camp and
  radar station get real `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` batches where the CLI-only Phase 0 run reported
  none (the Midway import script leaves `instance: false` for its unique pre-built hulls).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC-1 [local; actor: agent]: Phase 0 measurement table recorded for all 29 shipped Midway GLBs, plus a lossless dry run on `/tmp` copies (never `public/assets/`) showing flatten/join node-and-draw reduction and an `instance` run showing its current applicability — Evidence: measurement tables above, `/tmp/prd443/*.opt.glb`, `*.flat.glb`, `*.inst.glb`, this session's `gltf-transform` output.
- [x] AC-2 [local; actor: agent]: `@threenative/assets` ships `flatten`/`join`/`instance` passes gated by `assets.models.compact` (default on, named override), computed against one protected-node set (regex ∪ animation targets ∪ skin joints ∪ allow-list) — Evidence: `packages/assets/src/passes/compact.ts` (`compactModel`, `buildProtectedSet`, `resolveCompactOptions`), wired into `modelPass` (`packages/assets/src/passes/model.ts`) and validated in `compile.ts`; `pnpm --filter @threenative/assets typecheck` and `pnpm exec vitest run packages/assets/__tests__/` green (382 passed).
- [x] AC-3 [local; actor: agent]: Red→green unit test proves a protected node (regex match, animation target, skin joint, and an allow-listed name) survives `join`+`flatten` unmerged while an unprotected duplicate-material node gets merged, and a duplicated mesh across ≥2 nodes gets `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` — Evidence: `packages/assets/__tests__/compact-pass.spec.ts` (17 tests): a bare `join()` merges all four siblings and deletes `propeller_01` (red); a bare `flatten()` deletes a protected `VINTThreeNativePivot` and releases its mesh child to `join` (red); the pass keeps `propeller_01` (regex), `MyCustomPivot` (allow-list) and the pivot's child while merging the hull pair; three nodes sharing one mesh become one `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` batch of 3 with the self-verify's triangles/vertices/bounds unchanged; a rotated-node batch reconstructs world bounds; a sheared hierarchy compiles without drift; skin joints/animations preserved by name; removed named nodes are reported; a static child of an animated parent survives whichever channel is listed first; a 50-node shared mesh on an animated model is not duplicated.
- [x] AC-4 [local; actor: agent]: Compile report/summary lists per-pass before/after counts and every protected node with its protecting rule; a template `AGENTS.md` entry in `create-threenative` documents `assets.models.compact`'s default and override — Evidence: `IModelCompactSummary` is in `IModelPassOutputEntry` and the manifest, `compactLine()` in `packages/assets/src/report.ts` prints `flatten N -> M nodes, join P -> Q primitive(s), instance …` plus `protected <name> (<rule>)`; all 10 template `AGENTS.md` (and their generated `CLAUDE.md` mirrors) carry the `models.compact` paragraph; `create-threenative`'s config validator and the `@threenative/core` `IThreeNativeModelsConfig` type accept the key, proven by `packages/create-threenative/__tests__/config.spec.ts`.
- [x] AC-5 [local; actor: agent]: Midway re-imports `hornet.glb`, `akagi.glb`, `boat.pt59.glb`, `structures.garrison-camp.glb`, `structures.radar-station.glb` through the new passes into a scratch copy; `tools/compare-frames.mjs` (strict defaults) reports pixel-identical frames against the currently shipped assets, and `tools/bench-native.sh` shows the measured node/draw reduction with no frame-time regression — Evidence, 2026-09-25, run from `sandbox/midway-open-pacific` against the merged branch's `packages/assets/dist`, on Node 20.19.6 + pnpm 10.25.0 (the pair `package.json`/CI pin). The five shipped GLBs went through `modelPass({ passes: { dedup, prune }, compact: { protectedNames: <the 10 names Midway resolves with getObjectByName> }, textures: "none", vertexLayout: "separate", virtual: "none" })` into scratch copies: hornet 94→75 nodes / 94→75 prims, akagi 146→45 / 146→45 (20 `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` batches, 101 instances), boat.pt59 42→20 / 40→20, garrison-camp 26→16 / 26→16 (8 batches, 18 instances), radar-station 9→6 / 9→6 (1 batch, 2 instances). Every self-verify passed and `removed` named only flattened nodes — no protected name and no `getObjectByName` target. Frames: `bash tools/capture-lock.sh node tools/compare-frames.mjs capture …` for each arm and `diff` between them — same-build floor (stock vs a second stock run) 0.000 mean / 0.000% over-8 on all three views; compacted vs stock chase 0.000 / 0.001% (max 34), deck 0.000 / 0.000% (max 6), reflection 0.000 / 0.000% (max 20) — `FRAME DIFF PASS` against the 0.002 / 0.005% limits. Bench: desktop artifacts built from the same sources with only the five GLBs swapped, 120 s flights, arms interleaved in one session on an otherwise idle host — compacted p95 66.7 and 67.8 ms (fps 18.79 / 18.48) against stock p95 65.8 and 75.8 ms (fps 18.85 / 17.94); the compacted arm is not slower. Across the wider session the host itself drifts (65–123 ms p95 for both arms), which is why only the interleaved pair is comparable — the first, non-interleaved pair read the compacted arm as slower and the interleaved pair did not.
- [x] AC-6a [local; actor: agent]: Engine package version bump — Evidence: `packages/assets/package.json` is `0.3.4` and all ten `create-threenative` template manifests pin it; `pnpm exec tsx scripts/check-version-pins.ts` → `version pins ok: 11 workspace package versions cross-checked`.
- [x] AC-6b [local; actor: agent]: Tarball packed to `sandbox/.packages` with a content-hash suffix — Evidence: `pnpm pack` in `packages/assets` produced `threenative-assets-0.3.4.tgz` (1,679,522 bytes), staged as `sandbox/.packages/threenative-assets-0.3.4-prd443-530ae3a1c8f2.tgz`; the suffix is the tarball's own sha-256 prefix, the same convention `threenative-assets-0.3.3-d3509029a55d.tgz` follows.
- [x] AC-6c [local; actor: agent]: The packed engine installs and ships the pass — Evidence: a scratch consumer with `"@threenative/assets": "file:/tmp/prd443/pack/threenative-assets-0.3.4.tgz"` ran `pnpm install` clean under pnpm 10.25.0 and then imported `modelPass` from the *installed* package, compacting `structures.radar-station.glb` 9→6 nodes / 9→6 prims with 1 instancing batch — the pass is in the published artifact, not only in the worktree.
- [ ] AC-6d [local; actor: agent]: Midway's dependency repointed and `pnpm install` — **SUPERSEDED, not done:** Midway no longer takes a `file:` dependency on the engine. `midway-open-pacific` was moved to the published npm cohort in `b0cb5f3`/`7c050ff` (`@threenative/assets` 0.3.3 alongside `core`/`physics`/`ui`/`playtest` 0.3.3), and repointing one package to a local 0.3.4 tarball is exactly the mixed-cohort state `threenative doctor` was fixed to report. The rollout belongs with the 0.3.4 publish, not with this engine change.
- [ ] AC-6e [local; actor: agent]: Replace the five `public/assets/*.glb` with their AC-5-verified compacted equivalents — **NOT DONE, and deliberately not left half-applied:** the five files live in the `ThreeNativeHQ/examples` checkout (`sandbox/midway-open-pacific`), not in this repository, and that checkout is shared with several live lanes. The AC-5-verified compacted GLBs exist and were used for the frame and bench arms; landing them is a commit in the examples repository, not a file in this PR's tree.
- [ ] AC-6f [local; actor: agent]: `midway-open-pacific/tools/run-handoff.sh` green against the repointed engine — **BLOCKED by Midway's own gates, not by this change.** The lane runs against the checkout's current stock assets and npm 0.3.3 engine and reports `18 passed, 3 failed, 2 skipped`; the three reds are `scripts/check-carrier-cycle.mjs` (`the 68-aircraft cap was never reached in twelve minutes of operations` — a pure simulation gate that reads no asset), `tools/check-repair.mjs` (`page.waitForFunction: Timeout 30000ms exceeded`, a browser wait), and the launch/flight playtest (`TN_PLAYTEST_PERFORMANCE_ASSERTION_FAILED: performance.maxPassTriangles.main expected at most 1300000 triangles, observed 1560799` — Midway's own scene budget against its own scene, and compaction is lossless in triangles). None of the three reads the compaction, and all three were red before it: the 2026-09-23 run of the same lane reported `16 passed, 5 failed` with the same `check-carrier-cycle` red plus `check-carrier-assets` and `doctor`, both of which now pass.

## Integration Ledger

| Capability | Reachable consumer/trigger | Replaces / disposition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lossless model compaction (flatten/join/instance, protected-node rules) | `assets.models.compact` config → `compileModel()` in `packages/assets/src/passes/model.ts`, wired into `packages/assets/src/pass-chain.ts` | New pass, additive alongside existing dedup/prune/weld/quantize/simplify; `compact: false` opts out | AC-2/AC-3, Phase 2 |
| Same passes for Midway's pre-built hero GLBs | `tools/import-fleet.sh`, `tools/import-aircraft.sh` (Midway's GLBs never flow through `assets.models` — verified in Context) | Import scripts call the new engine-exported function in place of their current weld+simplify-only chain | AC-5, Phase 3 |
| Compaction reporting | Compile summary consumed by build logs / CI; extends the existing model-compile summary shape additively | AC-4, Phase 2 |

## Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: Measurement (this PRD)
**Status:** DONE
**ACs:** AC-1
- [x] Inspect all 29 Midway GLBs' node/mesh/material/animation/skin counts by direct glTF-JSON parsing
- [x] Run `gltf-transform flatten`/`join`/`instance` on `/tmp` copies to establish lossless headroom and the protected-node risk
**Files:** None changed (read-only inspection; artifacts left in `/tmp/prd443/`, not committed).
**Implementation:** Inspected all 29 Midway GLBs' node/mesh/material/animation/skin counts via direct glTF-JSON parsing; ran `gltf-transform flatten`/`join`/`instance` on copies to establish real lossless headroom and the protected-node risk.
**Verification:** E1 — commands and output reproduced in Context above; `/tmp/prd443/*.opt.glb`, `*.flat.glb`, `*.inst.glb` are the retained artifacts (not shipped).
**Checkpoint:** Self-review — no code changed, no asset in `public/assets/` touched, all counts independently reproducible with the commands shown.

#### Phase 2: Engine passes + protected-node rules
**Status:** DONE
**ACs:** AC-2, AC-3, AC-4
- [x] Ship `packages/assets/src/passes/compact.ts`: one protected-node set, flatten/instance/join orchestration via the `@gltf-transform/functions` SDK
- [x] Wire it into `modelPass` (`assets.models.compact` default on, `false` override) ahead of `prune`, and validate the key in `compile.ts`
- [x] Extend `reachableStats` for `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`, so the self-verify sees instanced geometry as the source saw it
- [x] Seven adversarial Opus 5.5 review rounds fixed protected-aware flatten, `MathUtils.compose`, animated-flatten closure, join exclusions (shared meshes, translated/scaled shape copies, multi-scene nodes), clone disposal and cache versioning; final review PASS
- [x] Unit tests: red→green protected-node survival, instancing fixture, zero-candidate report, config validation
- [x] Report + template docs: `compactLine()`, the manifest summary, and the `create-threenative`/`@threenative/core` config key
**Files:** `packages/assets/src/passes/compact.ts` (new), `packages/assets/src/passes/model.ts`, `packages/assets/src/compile.ts`, `packages/assets/src/report.ts`, `packages/assets/src/index.ts`, `packages/assets/__tests__/compact-pass.spec.ts` (new), `packages/create-threenative/src/config.ts`, `packages/core/src/config.ts`, the 10 template `AGENTS.md` (+ generated mirrors).
**Implementation:** Build the protected-node set once per model (regex default seeded from Midway's proven `MOVING_NODE` shape, animation-channel targets and ancestors, skin joints, `protectedNames` allow-list); call gltf-transform's SDK `flatten()`/`join()`/`instance()` transforms with that predicate rather than the CLI's boolean `--keepNamed`; extend the compile summary with per-pass before/after counts and the protected-node list with each one's protecting rule.
**Verification:** E1 — red: unit test asserting a protected regex-matching node survives join fails against the naive `join()` call (mirrors the measured hornet/akagi accident); green: passes once the predicate is wired in. E2 — a fixture with a duplicated mesh across nodes gets `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`; a fixture with no duplication reports 0 candidates without failing (matches the measured Midway case).
**Checkpoint:** `prd-work-reviewer` (MEDIUM) at end of phase — diff review against AC-2/AC-3/AC-4, confirm the protected-node predicate is actually consulted by `join`/`flatten`/`instance` and not bypassed.

#### Phase 3: Midway proof
**Status:** DONE — run in the `sandbox/midway-open-pacific` checkout on 2026-09-25; the artifacts are that checkout's, the evidence is above.
**ACs:** AC-5
- [x] Re-import the five headroom files through the new passes into scratch copies in `midway-open-pacific`
- [x] `tools/compare-frames.mjs` (strict defaults) pixel-identical against the shipped assets
- [x] `tools/bench-native.sh` shows the node/draw reduction with no p95 frame-time regression
**Files:** `midway-open-pacific/tools/import-fleet.sh`, `tools/import-aircraft.sh` (call the new engine function on the affected assets), no changes to `src/render/*` unless a name lookup needs updating (not expected — protected names are preserved by construction).
**Implementation:** Re-import `hornet.glb`, `akagi.glb`, `boat.pt59.glb`, `structures.garrison-camp.glb`, `structures.radar-station.glb` (the five files with measured headroom) through the new passes into scratch copies; do not touch `public/assets/` until AC-5 passes.
**Verification:** E1 — `bash tools/capture-lock.sh node tools/compare-frames.mjs capture <url> <dir>` on each arm, then `node tools/compare-frames.mjs diff <stock> <compacted>`: `FRAME DIFF PASS`, worst view `chase` at mean 0.000 / 0.001% over-8 against the 0.002 / 0.005% limits, with a stock-vs-stock same-build floor of 0.000 on every view. E2 — `bash tools/capture-lock.sh bash tools/bench-native.sh <artifact> 120 <outdir>` on desktop artifacts built from the same sources with only the five GLBs swapped; arms interleaved, compacted p95 66.7 / 67.8 ms against stock 65.8 / 75.8 ms. The re-import ran through the built `packages/assets/dist`, which is the same code the tarball ships.
**Checkpoint:** Self-review — the diff compared the compacted scratch copy against the shipped originals (not a self-comparison), the bench ran under `tools/capture-lock.sh` on a private Xvfb with the real NVIDIA adapter, and the non-interleaved first pair's apparent regression was re-measured interleaved and did not reproduce.

#### Phase 4: Release and repoint
**Status:** PARTIAL — the engine-side release is done (bump, tarball, install proof); the Midway-side rollout is superseded or belongs to the examples repository, and its last box is blocked by Midway's own red gates.
**ACs:** AC-6
- [x] Bump `packages/assets` and pin the ten template manifests at 0.3.4
- [x] Pack a content-hashed tarball into `sandbox/.packages`
- [x] Prove the packed engine installs and ships `modelPass`
- [ ] Repoint Midway and `pnpm install` — superseded: Midway installs the published npm cohort, and repointing one package to a local tarball recreates the mixed cohort `doctor` reports
- [ ] Replace the five `public/assets/*.glb` with their AC-5-verified compacted equivalents — belongs to the `ThreeNativeHQ/examples` checkout, which this PR's tree does not contain
- [ ] `midway-open-pacific/tools/run-handoff.sh` green against the repointed engine — blocked: `18 passed, 3 failed, 2 skipped`, and all three reds read no compacted asset (see AC-6f)
**Files:** `packages/assets/package.json` (version bump), `sandbox/.packages/` (new tarball), `midway-open-pacific/package.json` (repointed dependency), `public/assets/*.glb` (the five files, replaced with their compacted equivalents once AC-5 is green).
**Implementation:** `pnpm --filter ./packages/assets build && pnpm --filter ./packages/assets exec pnpm pack --pack-destination .../sandbox/.packages`; rename the tarball with a content-hash suffix; repoint Midway's dependency; `pnpm install`; replace the five `public/assets/*.glb` files with their compacted output; delete the hand-rolled weld-only step in the import scripts that the new passes now subsume.
**Verification:** E1 — the packed tarball installs into a scratch consumer and `modelPass` compacts from the installed package. E2 — `bash tools/run-handoff.sh` in `sandbox/midway-open-pacific`: `18 passed, 3 failed, 2 skipped`, with the three reds named on AC-6f and none of them reading the compaction. `node node_modules/create-threenative/dist/threenative.js doctor` and `node tools/check-carrier-assets.mjs`, both red on 2026-09-23, pass on the current cohort.
**Checkpoint:** Self-review — the tarball's content-hash suffix matches its own sha-256, no superseded `.tmp` tarball was left behind, and the compacted GLBs that the frame and bench arms measured are the ones the consumer proof and the tarball were built from.
