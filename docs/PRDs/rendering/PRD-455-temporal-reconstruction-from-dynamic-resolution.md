# PRD-455 — Fewer rendered pixels reconstruct into a stable full-resolution frame

**Status:** IN PROGRESS — full-resolution opt-in runtime milestone verified on browser software WebGPU; reconstruction remains open (2026-10-02).  
**Priority:** P1 — Its own note ranks it the highest-value rendering project; reconstruction and ghosting boxes unticked.
**Complexity:** 8 → HIGH. The renderer already has the difficult prerequisites; the remaining risk is history correctness and proving reconstruction wins more GPU time than it costs.  
**Depends on:** the landed motion-history implementation from PRD-269 (`packages/core/src/render/velocity.ts`, commit `3630847a`), its pending canonical [PR393 repair](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/pull/393) at `47e188e41601a64decb4fe0f580037546d63b543`, the existing `RenderChain`, and [PRD-384 adaptive resolution](../performance/PRD-384-adaptive-resolution-gpu-headroom.md).

## Problem

ThreeNative already has more temporal machinery than the old UE-gap notes describe:

- `RenderChain` knows `temporalReproject`, `taa` and `traa`, provisions velocity only when a
  temporal stage needs it, and measures rejected history.
- `VelocityTracker` retains rigid, skinned, instanced and batched previous-frame transforms.
- Native conformance scenes cover velocity, TAA, TRAA and temporal reprojection.
- `ResolutionScaler` can lower the internal raster size from measured GPU headroom.

What is still missing is the **TSR-like product outcome**: intentionally render the 3D scene below
display resolution, then reconstruct a stable display-resolution frame using temporal history rather
than simply presenting fewer pixels and sharpening them.

This PRD does not reimplement motion vectors, another resolution controller, or another render
chain.

## Outcome

When automatic resolution chooses a sub-1.0 render scale, one qualified reconstruction stage may
produce the display-resolution frame using current colour/depth, motion history and previous
reconstructed history. Camera cuts, resizes, invalid history and newly revealed surfaces reset or
reject history instead of smearing it.

At scale 1.0, or on a target where reconstruction costs more than it saves, the stage is absent and
the existing full-resolution path remains the baseline.

## Decisions

- **One reconstruction path first.** Do not ship several “quality modes” until one implementation
  survives the acceptance corpus.
- **The scaler owns resolution; reconstruction does not.** It consumes the actual internal/display
  sizes chosen by the existing renderer and never runs a competing controller.
- **History is disposable.** Resize, camera cut, projection discontinuity, device loss and explicit
  scene reset invalidate history immediately.
- **Velocity is necessary, not sufficient.** Disocclusion/newly revealed pixels must reject history;
  zero velocity does not prove a sample is safe.
- **No look preset in core.** Sharpening remains authored render-chain source. Reconstruction's
  public knobs, if any survive measurement, are correctness/performance limits rather than a visual
  style.

## Implementation order (owner direction, 2026-10-02)

First qualify plain full-resolution temporal AA using the installed Three.js 0.185.1 TRAANode,
RenderChain and VelocityTracker. The generated game owns the opt-in provider and history-reset
policy; no template default changes. Add a deterministic shared fixture, CPU regressions and a
maintained headed WebGPU screenshot lane before attempting lower-resolution reconstruction.
Then extend the existing renderer sizing seam to distinguish internal and display dimensions,
retain one scaler, and qualify the original reconstruction/visual/performance outcomes below.
Every PR revision retains actual runtime screenshots when the hosted capture lane can execute;
CPU-only checks never qualify image quality or native/hardware performance. Do not promote this
experimental path or mark the draft ready before the outstanding acceptance evidence exists.

## Integration ledger

| Existing surface | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core/src/render/chain.ts` | Add a reconstruction-capable stage contract that knows input raster size and output display size; reuse existing velocity provisioning/reporting. |
| `packages/core/src/render/velocity.ts` | Reuse current history; no second transform tracker. |
| `packages/core/src/resolution-scaler.ts` | No new policy. Expose/consume the resolved scale and reset history on size transitions. |
| `packages/runtime-native/conformance/scenes/shared/` | Add one reconstruction scene that runs the same source on browser/native targets. |

### Phase 1 — Define history correctness before chasing image quality

- [x] Full-resolution temporal AA is opt-in generated source, uses the existing velocity source and resets history on discontinuity. **proof:** hosted run `36990452407` at `9b6a3c6164602cfc710f04e0ea8f078832e3cd23` passes all five real runtime variants; 24 actual AA resolves, cut/projection/resize resets at frame 21, valid history by frame 24; exact source tests and actual screenshots below. Browser SwiftShader correctness only; native and visual-quality/performance superiority remain unqualified.

  Partial, 2026-10-02: the installed TRAANode setup/jitter regression reproduced
  `setProjectionMatrix is not a function` because RenderChain supplied a sampled texture where
  Three expects its velocity accessor. The caller now keeps accessor and texture separate;
  `vitest run packages/core/__tests__/{temporal-chain,render-chain,render-velocity}.spec.ts
  --maxWorkers=1` passes 56 tests after fresh-checkout red-to-green reproduction. No runtime,
  image-quality, native, or performance qualification is claimed by these CPU tests.

  Partial, 2026-10-02: starter-only generated `temporalAA.ts` now reuses TRAANode and owns
  explicit cut/reset, projection/size invalidation, raster-size guards and disposal. The shared
  fixture exercises moving rigid/skinned/instanced content; the `temporal` lane of
  `integration.yml` captures
  reference, temporal, cut, projection and resize variants through the existing headed playtest
  runner. Fresh focused checks: 297/297 source/scaffold/workflow tests, 67/67 native-conformance
  contract tests, root TypeScript check, core build, fixture web build and shared native bundle
  all pass. These are source/contracts/builds, not native execution. Local runtime capture was
  attempted and refused because this environment has neither Xvfb nor a usable X display;
  the hosted lane must supply actual screenshots and adapter evidence before this box is checked.
  The complete repository test/budget/quality board and temporal visual-quality corpus are still
  unrun for this slice. The optional conformance row does not qualify any native target.

  Follow-up, 2026-10-02: hosted run `36986673556` passed 61 focused tests, then failed in
  the source-loaded runner's serialized callback (`__name` undefined), before temporal evidence.
  The verifier now imports the freshly built public runner rather than source-transpiled browser
  callbacks and preserves early failure diagnostics. A fresh red-to-green lifecycle regression
  also requires reset frames to overwrite **both** resolved output and next-frame history with
  current colour after upstream bookkeeping; a pre-resolve seed alone still reprojects at shifted
  UVs and is not complete rejection. Five lifecycle tests pass; screenshot proof remains pending.

- [x] The reconstruction stage produces a display-sized output from a smaller colour/depth input and records input size, output size, history-valid state and rejection fraction. **proof:** focused render-chain test runs 0.67→1.0 sizing, then a mutation returning the low-resolution target directly fails the output-size assertion. **result, 2026-10-06:** `packages/create-threenative/__tests__/temporal-aa.spec.ts` -t "presents a display-sized raster" drives the real `RenderChain` over the generated `temporalAAStages` `traa` factory and the same stubbed renderer the other sizing tests use. One arm reports the scene pass target at 1280×720 while the node the chain presents holds 1920×1080, with `report()` carrying `inputWidth 1280`, `inputHeight 720`, `outputWidth 1920`, `outputHeight 1080`, `historyValid false` on the opening reset and the measured `rejection { fraction 4/2073600, visited 2073600, staleFrames 0 }`. The mutated layer is `stages[0].build` in the test fixture: the generated stage still builds the provider and still owns its per-frame work, and the chain is handed the scene pass colour node instead of `provider.node`. The same `expectDisplayRaster` assertion then fails with the exact message `The presented raster is 1280x720, not the display raster 1920x1080.`, and the presented node's own render target measures 1280×720 — the low-resolution target — so the failure is classified at the output-raster contract, not at a missing measurement, a startup refusal or a canvas label. 26/26 in the file; root `pnpm typecheck` and `biome check` exit 0. No core change, no new dependency, no threshold touched. Runtime evidence for the same arm is the qualified browser/native result already recorded above.
- [x] Camera cuts, projection changes and resolution changes invalidate history for the affected frame; moving skinned and instanced fixtures use the existing velocity source rather than a camera-only approximation. **proof:** deterministic fixture covers cut/resize/skinned/instanced cases and a zero-velocity mutation fails the moving-object rejection/stability assertion. **result, 2026-10-05:** the browser lane, the registered native row `temporal-aa-lifecycle` and the real `vec2(0)` MRT mutation — see the section at the end of this file.

### Phase 2 — Prove motion stability on content that exposes temporal defects

The next maintained full-resolution measurement captures frames 21–36 from the actual generated
helper/RenderChain, matched against a 4× raster reference numerically integrated in linear RGB.
It measures edge error, changes in reference-relative error (excluding true scene motion), and
stale-colour residue inside a two-pixel inset after a contrasting occluder disappears at frame 29.
The fixture also renders zero-velocity and unchecked 95% history controls. The latter bypasses
both depth rejection and neighbourhood clipping; it does not isolate either mechanism or report
the shader's per-pixel rejection fraction. Before the first runtime measurement, the experimental
bar is pinned at 5% edge/instability improvement versus no-AA, at most 1% stale interior pixels
after one frame, and detectable negative controls. Five numerical tests and the fixture bundle
pass; hosted sequence results remain pending. These checks do not qualify reconstruction or the
broader foliage/content corpus below.

First actual sequence, source `1124d7036787488b9fa9adf4aecbd535a099654c`, hosted run
`36994374046`: **quality gate failed**. All five arms rendered, all diagnostics were empty,
and 80 PNG hashes were verified. Temporal error instability improves 10.1%, but edge error worsens
13.5% versus no-AA. Stale-colour residue remains on 19.2% of 3,721 newly revealed interior pixels
one frame later and drops below 1% only after seven frames. The zero-velocity arm has lower moving
edge error than the temporal arm; this requires projection/velocity-grid/history-timing diagnosis
before any blend tuning. Unchecked history is detected on 100% of revealed pixels. The original
thresholds remain unchanged. [Complete measurements/provenance](../../verification/prd455/motion-runtime.json),
[before reveal](../../verification/prd455/motion-before.png),
[matched no-AA reference](../../verification/prd455/motion-reference.png),
[failed temporal reveal](../../verification/prd455/motion-reveal.png), and
[later recovery](../../verification/prd455/motion-recovery.png) retain genuine unchanged frame bytes.
All 80 frames remain in the workflow artifact; these four selected frames were inspected.

The next diagnostic retains the same scene, resolve and thresholds and reads actual velocity MRT
pixels at interior rigid, instanced and skinned surface points. A CPU oracle projects the same
surface points from consecutive rendered poses using unjittered camera matrices; observations
also retain the projection used during the draw and the tracker-scheduled instance/bone history.
This tests NDC sign, grid scale and previous/current timing before changing blend or shader policy.
The fixture-only readback is explicitly excluded from performance claims. Its TypeScript uses
the existing `@types/three` 0.185.3 development cohort; the Three runtime pin remains 0.185.1.

Probe run `36997077219`, source `dd541a46d871e5bf871d179d694d5ef7b54858db`, confirms two separate
input defects. The rigid velocity error matches the exact current Halton jitter within 0.000290
pixel across all 16 frames; the first input-pass material compiled while VelocityNode's explicit
projection was still null. The helper now primes TRAA's own unjittered matrix during setup, before
the dependency can compile that material, without applying camera jitter early. A real
VelocityNode.setup regression fails before the fix and passes afterward; the maintained GPU
oracle now requires rigid velocity error below 0.01 pixel. Hosted run `36998277547` at
`0564aaaf0a45e7f51e901c63bccd3753debc0322` passes that MRT check across all 16 matched frames;
the image-quality gate remains red (edge error 0.06070, instability 0.03196, reveal residue 22.6%
after one frame).
The repaired rigid velocity's maximum oracle error is 0.000308 pixel;
[exact runtime record](../../verification/prd455/projection-fixed.json) and
[actual frame 30](../../verification/prd455/projection-fixed.png) preserve this partial result.
That run's no-AA frame 30 is byte-identical to the linked earlier reference. All 96 screenshot
hashes were verified and every arm's diagnostics are empty; the repaired frame was inspected.
Separately, instanced velocity has 9.34-pixel mean error, and a dynamic-buffer control reduces this
to 1.00 pixel but leaves timing error. The shipped previous-instance attribute upload/ordering
defect belongs to PRD-269/PR393 and is not patched here. All original quality thresholds remain.

A re-setup regression also reproduced copying an active camera jitter into the saved projection.
The helper now tracks its own active view offset, preserves the unjittered matrix during setup,
and avoids applying the same frame jitter twice. The maintained recompile arm changes the public
renderer context-node version and must observe both a repeated setup during jitter and correct
MRT velocity. Hosted run `36999580189` at `2b9bdf16aba68c86ba5f8ce0af784727a215c8ed`
observes setup count 1→2 while jitter is active at frame 23, with maximum rigid error 0.000308
pixel. Ordinary temporal PNGs remain byte-identical to the prior run. A separate fixture-only
strict-rejection arm sets
TRAA edgeDepthDiff to 1 to test its documented depth-edge exception without changing blend weights,
any quality threshold, or generated appearance policy.
[Actual control frame](../../verification/prd455/edge-exception-control.png) and
[all original scores/lifecycle evidence](../../verification/prd455/edge-exception-control.json)
record the measured comparison. Strict rejection yields zero projected stale pixels one frame
after reveal, but 59 late pixels still trip that score; inspecting them shows dark-blue fence
undercoverage, which can point toward the old red vector without added red. The score remains
unchanged and conservative. A separate matched open-history control and red-excess diagnostic
are being added to isolate causal tint; regressions reject neutral brightening/darkening and
recover a known 25% injected red history. The independent edge-quality bar remains red.

Hosted causal run `37001381134`, source `5c071b4b757537b0fa48f780839b6a96933eafe5`, captures
176 matched sequence frames across 11 arms with empty diagnostics. Against each policy's own
never-occluded temporal control, standard temporal AA has red tint on 11.61% of revealed pixels
one frame later; strict rejection has 0% in all eight reveal frames; unchecked history has 100%
throughout. [Exact causal results and unchanged original scores](../../verification/prd455/causal-history.json)
and the [actual matched open-history frame](../../verification/prd455/causal-open-control.png)
retain this diagnostic. Frame bytes/hashes were checked and the selected control was inspected.
The new causal diagnostic does not replace or weaken the original gate. Appearance experiments
pause here until PR393's verified instance-history fix is consumed and the fixed benchmark reruns.

Dependency integration, 2026-10-02: PR398 explicitly merges the exact reviewed PR393 commit
`47e188e41601a64decb4fe0f580037546d63b543`, preserving the canonical patch and its ancestry.
Its separate signed WebGPU oracle run `37003076606` passed; combined temporal quality remains
pending until this branch reruns all 176 frames with the original thresholds and controls.
The merge also includes landed tone gate `924b92f825d602485ef4e682f434b4757a825cd7`.
PR393 must land before PR398 can become ready or merge, and PR398 must then refresh onto the
resulting develop so its final diff excludes the prerequisite repair. No acceptance box changes.
Frozen offline installation accepts the new Three patch and retains runtime pin 0.185.1; all 87
focused helper, scaffold, numerical quality, evidence and velocity-probe tests pass. Actual
generation changes only the starter hash relative to the PR393 hashes, as expected from this
branch's generated temporal helper. Fresh combined core validation passes 176 files and 2,222 tests, with two skipped. Root types,
error-level lint, documentation links and the unchanged evidence budget pass. Core rebuild and
public playtest build/publint pass; the latter uses the identical assertion-generator check via
`node --import tsx` because the package-script tsx CLI hits the local IPC restriction. Hosted
measurement is recorded below; the complete repository board remains unqualified.
Evidence validation: 29 documentation/citation/budget tests pass; two CLI-launch tests hit the
known environment prohibition on tsx IPC pipes. Their unchanged 1,200-line and 701-file CLI
fixtures both pass through `node --import tsx`. The real tracked evidence budget also passes.

Phase 2 proof route, 2026-10-06: the missing route now exists and has run. One bounded quality
family reuses the same scene, poses, occluder and frame schedule as the existing arms and adds
authored deterministic alpha-tested foliage: six leaf cards with a 16x16 DataTexture mask (nearest
filtered, `alphaTest` 0.5, no canvas, identical on both hosts). Its physical display raster stays
640x360 for every arm. The input raster is 426x240 (2/3) for the spatial role, the temporal role and
their controls, 1:1 for the full-resolution no-AA role, and 4x supersampled for the family
reference, which the existing scorer downsamples. The full-resolution reference, the no-AA control
and the spatial role request no reconstruction stage and no velocity MRT at all; the spatial role
presents its low input through the ordinary texture upsample. The harness asserts that per frame —
`stages: []`, `velocity.source: null`, no rejection counter and no MRT readback — instead of
installing a stage and overriding its output. The temporal role must present 640x360 from a 426x240
input and publish the settled GPU counter every frame. Each family scores against its own
supersampled reference, and every original threshold is unchanged.

`sh scripts/xvfb.sh node --import tsx scripts/verify-temporal-motion.ts` captured 31 arms
(558 PNGs) with `nvidia`/`turing` WebGPU in every arm, empty diagnostics, and exit 1 at the final
gate assertion after writing `artifacts/temporal-aa/motion/summary.json`; log
`/tmp/opencode/pr398-phase2-route3.log`. Rasters are the measured ones: the family reference is
2560x1440 input and display, the no-AA role 640x360/640x360, and every low-input arm 426x240 input
into a 640x360 display. The temporal counter is real: rejection fraction 0.0023-0.0110 with
`visited` 230400 on every frame, exactly the 640x360 display raster it walked, and `staleFrames` 0.

| arm | edge | instability | excursion | moving edge | stale f29..36 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality-reference (no AA, 1:1) | 0.04933 | 0.04768 | 0.01632 | 0.03547 | 0, 0, .0003, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 |
| quality-spatial (0.667, no stage) | 0.07745 | 0.05055 | 0.00964 | 0.04800 | .0306, .0304, .0648, .0355, .0357, .0664, .0473, .0312 |
| quality-temporal (0.667) | 0.08240 | 0.03572 | 0.00216 | 0.04618 | .3437, .2548, .0398, .0339, .0304, .0395, .0226, .0185 |
| quality-zero-velocity | 0.08971 | 0.03283 | 0.00401 | 0.05971 | .3451, .2580, .0468, .0417, .0414, .0513, .0357, .0314 |
| quality-unchecked-history | 0.09744 | 0.03050 | 0.20525 | 0.12529 | 1.00 in all eight |

The temporal arm is 29.3% more stable than the low-resolution spatial arm, which is the comparison
its Phase 2 box names. The spatial role's own non-zero reveal residue is the low raster's
occluder footprint resampled by the upsample, not a history. Both negative controls are detected:
the real `vec2(0)` MRT control is worse on moving edges, and unchecked history holds 100% stale
pixels with red tint 1.00 in every reveal frame. The motion family reproduced bit-identically
(edge 0.06054, instability 0.03136, no-AA 0.05029/0.04913), which also proves the new browser flags
did not change the existing measurement.

**Both Phase 2 boxes stay open.** `qualityEdgeImprovement` fails: 0.08240 against the required
0.04686, 67% worse than the family's no-AA arm. `qualityRevealRecovery` fails: 25.48% stale
interior pixels one frame after the reveal, against the unchanged 1% bound, and the strict-rejection
motion control still trips the same bound at frame 34. Nothing was renormalized and no threshold was
relaxed. Focused checks: root `pnpm typecheck` exit 0, Biome error-level exit 0 on all three
changed files, 122 temporal unit tests across 9 files pass, `pnpm check:docs` exit 0. The one
repository lint error is the pre-existing cognitive-complexity finding in
`examples/native-smoke/src/physics.ts`, which this change does not touch.

One bounded next defect, in the generated appearance layer and not in this mechanism: at a 426x240
input the installed history blend trades edge fidelity for stability (67% worse edge error than
no-AA while beating the spatial arm by 29% on instability), which repeats the static thin-fence
attenuation already measured at full resolution. The next task repairs the generated resolve blend;
Phase 3 cost work stays untouched.

**Ghost root cause measured, and the obvious hypothesis falsified, 2026-10-06.** The default
resolve's history decision is `historyValid ∧ validUV ∧ (edge ∨ ¬disocclusion)`, where
`disocclusion` is upstream's one-sided `closestDepth − previousDepth > threshold`. An occluder
moving *away* leaves the current surface farther than the previous one, so a one-sided test calls
that valid history and keeps the hidden colour — the suspected cause of the reveal residue. Making
that test two-sided (`|closestDepth − previousDepth|`, which installed three 0.185.1
`TAAUNode.js` itself applies and names as the remedy for its own one-sided test) was compiled
through the real WGSL builder, red-green in `temporal-resolve.spec.ts`, and then measured over the
whole 31-arm corpus. It moved nothing: the default arm's eight reveal fractions are bit-identical
(.2833, .1795, .086, .0817, .0605, .0392, .0164, .0145) and its edge 0.06054, instability 0.03136 and
excursion 0.000118 are unchanged, because every revealed pixel satisfies the depth-edge bypass that
outranks the disocclusion term. On the two arms that disable that bypass the change is a measured
regression: `strict-rejection` instability 0.03139 → 0.07597, excursion 0.000115 → 0.013923, and its
stale fractions [.0177, 0, 0, 0, 0, .0159, .0003, 0] → [.0177, .0024, .0339, 0, 0, .0019, .0172,
.0167]; `resolve-cubic-strict` the same. More rejection is not monotonically better, because the
metric projects each residual onto the pre-reveal colour direction and unlocked jitter crosses it
too. Every negative control, the zero-velocity controls, the GPU counter (rejection 0.00064–0.00172
of 230400 visited display pixels, `staleFrames` 0) and the 15-check vector were unchanged. The
change was therefore reverted; no artefact from it ships.

What the corpus does say: the edge bypass is load-bearing for the ghost, because the bypass-off
arm already holds edge 0.06055, instability 0.03139 and excursion 0.000115 — indistinguishable from
the default — while cutting the residue from .2833 to .0177. A repair has to disocclude the revealed
pixels without unlocking the surfaces the bypass protects, so it needs a per-pixel reason (real
geometry change against depth-edge membership) rather than the edge range alone or a wider
threshold. Both Phase 2 ghost boxes stay open.

- [ ] A fixed camera route containing thin fences, foliage, sub-pixel edges, a moving character and an instanced moving object stays within pinned temporal-stability/ghosting thresholds against a full-resolution reference. **proof:** automated frame-sequence report records edge flicker, rejected-history ratio and image delta for full-res, low-res spatial upscale and temporal reconstruction; the temporal arm must beat the spatial arm on the named stability metric.
- [ ] Newly revealed surfaces do not inherit stale colour after occlusion/disocclusion events. **proof:** foreground-occluder fixture reveals a contrasting background and asserts stale-history pixels decay within the declared frame bound; disabling disocclusion rejection makes it fail.

### Phase 3 — Keep it only if it buys real frame time

- [ ] On a GPU-bound representative game, sub-1.0 rendering plus reconstruction lowers GPU/render p95 versus full-resolution rendering while meeting the Phase-2 visual thresholds. **proof:** paired fixed-route browser WebGPU and desktop-native table records internal pixels, reconstruction cost, total GPU/render p50/p95 and visual metrics; no “FPS only” verdict.
- [ ] Automatic resolution can move between at least three scales during one run without history corruption, allocation growth or a reconstruction cost spike larger than the saved raster cost. **proof:** scripted scaler route records scale transitions, history resets, render-target allocation count and per-stage cost; repeated up/down cycles end at the initial allocation baseline.

### Current execution notes

Fresh full core CPU directory: 175 test files passed, 2,209 tests passed, two skipped, using pinned
pnpm and `--maxWorkers=1`. The initial full-directory attempt exposed a child-command environment
failure in the hot-subpath declaration test; the correct environment passed that test, then the
entire directory was rerun green. This is still not the complete repository board.
Hosted run `36987345933` advances past the bundled-runner repair but fails the strict console-error
guard on one 404 in the reference fixture. The next fixture serves its compiled build and declares
an explicit data favicon. Every fixed step now waits for Three's existing RAF frame boundary, and
the verifier requires the AA resolve count to equal the fixture count. The verifier also rejects
`TN_PLAYTEST_SOFTWARE_DEVICE_LOST` even when the generic runner downgrades it to a warning; unit
regressions retain that fail-closed requirement. No visual acceptance box is inferred from a green
CPU gate or the diagnostic reference frame.

Hosted run `36988336664` proves the reference arm completes 24 RAF-separated frames with no
console or device-loss diagnostics, then the temporal arm fails before bridge installation. The
fixture now preserves startup exceptions through its diagnostic bridge instead of losing the cause
as a generic missing-bridge error. Error diagnostics take precedence over absent capture provenance
without weakening either requirement. Full root lint was run: five new fixture format/declaration
errors were corrected; a fresh whole-root error-level check then passed (existing warnings remain).

Hosted run `36989246532` exposes the actual temporal startup failure: the colour/depth/velocity
size guard runs before the lazy scene-pass dependency. The wrapper now registers the three input
nodes in NodeBuilder properties, following upstream GaussianBlur/FSR1's dependency mechanism, so
Three updates the existing input pass before temporal sizing/resolve; no second draw loop is added.
The dependency regression fails before this change and passes afterward. The verifier additionally
runs the existing `assertCaptureNotBlank` guard on every PNG: the failed temporal artifact has one
colour and is correctly rejected, while the clean reference has 1,641 colours and passes unchanged
thresholds. Pending hosted execution must establish the repaired temporal arm before acceptance.

- [Raster-resize recovery](../../verification/prd455/fullres-resize.png): 960×540 input **and output**,
  presented on the 1280×720 canvas; this is the baseline resize path, not reconstruction.

This verifies runtime operation/reset recovery in the narrow fixture. Edge-flicker/ghosting
thresholds, same-frame reset image comparisons, native execution and hardware frame-time wins
remain open. The PR stays draft and no shipped quality tier enables this helper.


- [Diagnostic no-AA reference](../../verification/prd455/diagnostic-reference.png), hosted run
  `36986673556`, source `bbbf93ca8c10a30b168fdb984d31a7567ebeccaf`. Actual canvas PNG inspected;
  [provenance](../../verification/prd455/diagnostic-reference.json) records SwiftShader/software
  WebGPU. This is a baseline progress frame, not temporal/motion/native/performance proof.
  The run stopped at the source-runner callback error; fixed-step rendering also needs a distinct
  Three.js frame boundary before temporal frame counts can qualify a motion sequence.

## Acceptance criteria

The win is **not** “TRAA is enabled.” The win is that a lower internal raster produces a stable
display-resolution image during motion, saves measured frame time, and degrades safely when history
cannot be trusted.

If the qualified reconstruction path does not beat the existing full-resolution path on a
GPU-bound workload after accounting for its own cost, it stays optional/experimental rather than
becoming a default.


### Combined canonical motion-history result

Source `e48c31b8ec63a0e74f971c4d7c9938da1eff1589`, exact PR393 input
`47e188e41601a64decb4fe0f580037546d63b543`, hosted run `37004283653`: all 176 named
PNG hashes verify and all eleven diagnostics are empty. Actual instance velocity now has maximum
error 0.000986 pixel; default and dynamic instance arms produce identical PNG sequences. The
zero-velocity negative control now correctly worsens moving-edge error: 0.04169 versus 0.03024.
Rigid error remains at most 0.000308 pixel; skinned point error is at most 0.01558 pixel.

The original quality gate still fails: edge error 0.06001 versus no-AA 0.05061, despite residual
instability improving to 0.03119 from 0.04915. The original reveal score remains 22.6% one frame
after reveal; causal red tint remains 11.61%, while the strict fixture control measures zero
causal red tint throughout. No threshold or appearance policy changed. Recompilation also exposes
a separate one-frame instance corner: frame 23 reports zero object-Y motion instead of the expected
-0.00289756 NDC, a 0.52156-pixel error; later frames recover. That lifecycle corner remains open.

[Exact combined measurements, dependency ancestry and screenshot provenance](../../verification/prd455/combined-history.json)
and [actual combined temporal frame 30](../../verification/prd455/combined-temporal.png) retain
unchanged renderer bytes. The frame was inspected; the matched no-AA reference bytes are unchanged
from the earlier linked reference. The separate velocity and tone workflows also pass on this exact
combined source, while temporal intentionally fails the unchanged quality bar.


The next fixture-only diagnostic observes the already-compiled instance draw at frames 22–24,
recording the actual vertex shader, matrix attribute bytes/versions and object identities. It
does not invoke another compile or render, and releases its temporary draw observer on disposal.
The existing quality thresholds and appearance stay unchanged. This isolates the one-frame
recompile corner before any engine patch; PR393 retains canonical motion-history ownership.
A separate HDR-reference hypothesis is not supported by the captured sequence: across all 32
reference/no-AA PNGs, non-marker channel maxima are 189/227/242 and no non-marker channel
saturates. The authored marker is unit red. No reference method or score has been changed.


A fixture-only nearest-history control and its matching never-occluded arm test whether repeated
bilinear history reprojection causes the thin-edge blur. They add 32 actual captures to the
unchanged original 176-frame corpus and use the same numerical evaluator; all original gates
remain authoritative. The control changes only the history texture sampler. Nearest sampling can
snap under subpixel motion, so it is a causal experiment, not an adopted filter or product mode.


Hosted draw diagnostic `37005814851` stopped at the bridge's JSON-safety guard: the installed
InstancedBufferAttribute exposes numeric `id`, not `uuid`. Direct construction reproduces the
undefined field. The diagnostic now records `matrixId`; no renderer, history or quality logic
changes. The earlier combined 176-frame evidence remains valid; this diagnostic run is incomplete.


Source `12704356112ed1bba9c29af57faa9021fb5cf978`, run `37006364268`, completes all
208 captures with empty diagnostics; every PNG hash verifies and the original 176 PNGs are
byte-identical to combined source `e48c31b8`. Nearest history worsens edge error to 0.07036
(from 0.06001), residual instability to 0.03246 (from 0.03119), and moving-edge error to
0.03528 (from 0.03024). It is rejected as a quality fix. Its causal red-tint fraction remains
6.21% one frame after reveal. [Inspected actual control frame](../../verification/prd455/nearest-history.png)
and [exact measurements, draw states and provenance](../../verification/prd455/history-sampling.json)
retain the failed experiment.

The actual frame-22/23/24 vertex shaders are identical and explicitly multiply distinct previous
instance attributes. The mesh, matrix and interleaved-buffer identities persist. At the frame-23
draw, current and previous CPU Y are -0.6999545693 and -0.6924691796, both buffers have version 23,
and both before-frame and before-object events are present. The observed GPU object-Y velocity
remains zero. Thus missing previous assignment and stale scheduled CPU arrays do not explain the
recompile corner; actual upload/binding state remains under investigation in canonical PR393.

The next quality experiment will retain TRAANode's allocation, jitter and history lifecycle while
comparing a game-owned Catmull–Rom history sampler. An authored-linear control must reproduce the
installed resolve before interpreting the higher-order filter. This follows the reconstruction
problem discussed by [Emilio López](https://www.elopezr.com/temporal-aa-and-the-quest-for-the-holy-trail/)
and [Alex Tardif](https://alextardif.com/TAA.html); it does not establish that the proposed filter
passes this fixture or the broader acceptance corpus.


Before a higher-order filter is tested, the evaluator gains an additional local-reference
excursion diagnostic: a pre-reveal pixel is outside its 3×3 reference RGB bounds by more than
0.01. The fixed allowance exceeds one 8-bit sRGB code step in linear light. Exact/quantized
controls score zero and an injected halo fails in a numerical red-to-green regression. This
reports possible halos or undercoverage, not a causal classification of ringing; the original
edge, instability and reveal scores/gates remain unchanged.

The recompile diagnostic now also records attribute-wrapper identities, backend create/update
calls, pre-existing shared GPU buffers and render-call deduplication state. It copies actual
current/previous matrix GPU bytes through the installed renderer readback API after those same
three draws. No extra render is introduced, and diagnostic readback remains excluded from any
performance claim. The canonical PR393 worker is investigating a fresh-wrapper/shared-buffer
upload hypothesis; no engine repair is duplicated here.


Actual GPU readback at source `aabfa0272b486d345010d00aadeeb042e6cf2b39`, run `37008638293`,
confirms the recompile cause. Frame 23 creates four fresh current-matrix attribute wrappers over
the existing GPU buffer. Each backend create call sees that buffer already present and uploads
nothing: GPU current Y remains -0.6924691796 from frame 22 despite CPU Y=-0.6999545693.
Previous GPU Y correctly advances to -0.6924691796, so the velocity becomes zero. Frame 24 issues
an update and catches up. All 208 PNGs remain byte-identical and diagnostics empty.
[Exact actual-upload and GPU-byte evidence](../../verification/prd455/matrix-upload.json) is
forwarded to PR393's owner; the engine repair remains canonical there.

The experimental generated `temporalResolve.ts` now retains Three.js 0.185.1's resolve equations
with source attribution and MIT notice, then offers an explicit linear/Catmull–Rom history
sampling comparison. It creates no target and owns no jitter, depth copy, frame loop or history
lifetime. The kernel's independently evaluated polynomial tests cover sample-centre identity,
constant/linear/quadratic reconstruction and negative lobes. The actual quality gate is still red
from the previous source; these CPU tests do not qualify the new filter.

The maintained candidate run adds an authored-linear arm, cubic and cubic+strict-rejection arms,
matching never-occluded controls and a matched cubic+strict zero-velocity control, for 304 total
frames. Authored-linear output must be byte-identical to the installed temporal arm before any
cubic finding is interpretable. Original scores and thresholds remain; additional candidate
reports compare edge error, instability, both reveal diagnostics and neighbourhood excursions
against both no-AA and the installed temporal arm. The cubic filter clamps negative history
samples before the existing variance clip. Ringing and cost remain open until measured.


Frozen candidate review checkpoint: 135 focused tests pass, including all 13 actual generated
scaffold hashes; only starter changes. Root types, error-level lint, quality scanner, fixture
build, documentation links, evidence budget and instruction mirrors pass. Evidence JSON was
formatted without changing parsed values or PNG bytes. Independent review is required before
publishing this shader increment or running its hosted comparison. No candidate quality result
is claimed and all remaining acceptance boxes stay open.

Review correction: authored-linear equivalence now participates in the aggregate pass and has
its own assertion after the complete summary is saved. A mismatch invalidates cubic
interpretation even if every original quality check passes; the failure names the retained
artifact. Red-green regressions cover both passing and failing original checks. Non-strict
cubic is explicitly diagnostic-only because it lacks a matched zero-velocity control and is
excluded from qualification. No original quality threshold or runtime arm changed.
Empty check sets also save `pass: false` before throwing a missing-checks error; equivalence
failure retains precedence. The new false-pass regression went red-green; both empty-set paths
and the existing checks now pass.

Actual 304-frame run `37016735368`, source `3afcbc66a8101be6a39bac489e09d3f75b8895c4`,
passes authored-linear equivalence: all 16 PNGs are byte-identical to installed TRAA. All 304
hashes verify, all 19 arm diagnostics are empty and the earlier 208 PNGs remain unchanged.
Cubic+strict improves edge error relative to installed temporal (0.05605 versus 0.06001), but
still loses to no-AA (0.05061) and misses the fixed 5% improvement bar. Instability is 0.03173;
causal red tint is zero across all reveal frames. Conservative reveal projection and excursions
versus installed temporal still fail. Its matched zero-velocity arm degrades moving-edge error
from 0.02470 to 0.04169. The unqualified result and all controls are retained in
[exact cubic experiment evidence](../../verification/prd455/cubic-history.json), with inspected
[before](../../verification/prd455/cubic-strict-frame-27.png),
[reveal](../../verification/prd455/cubic-strict-frame-30.png) and
[recovery](../../verification/prd455/cubic-strict-frame-36.png) runtime frames.

The next explicit dependency merge consumes canonical PR393 uploader repair
`ac7e78978854beea2c7db1026b26da5ea2f71716`, whose actual GPU recompile gate passed in run
`37016640068`. Frozen offline install and 199 focused combined tests pass. The only merge
conflict was the scaffold hash table; all thirteen were measured and only starter differs
from the incoming dependency because it includes this PR's generated temporal source.
The identical 304-frame benchmark must run on the combined source before its result can be
attributed to this new dependency. Neither the earlier experiment nor the dependency's separate
oracle establishes that combined result. PR393 still must land before this PR becomes ready.

Combined run `37018389700` on `e638fc470f2c36d59b2046de4822cfd406424048` now verifies
the canonical uploader repair in this temporal helper's actual recompile path. All 304 PNG
hashes verify and all 19 diagnostics are empty. Recompile matches ordinary temporal pixels,
metrics and MRT samples exactly across all 16 frames. Frame 23 instance error falls from
0.52156 pixel to 0.00005972 pixel; the sequence maximum is 0.0009863 pixel. Actual GPU current
Y now equals CPU current Y=-0.6999545693 while previous Y remains -0.6924691796.
Only recompile frames 23–36 change from the previous source; all other pixels and scores remain
unchanged. Authored-linear equivalence still passes, while the same image-quality gates fail.
[Combined provenance, unchanged metrics and corrected readback](../../verification/prd455/combined-cubic-history.json)
and the inspected [corrected recompile frame](../../verification/prd455/recompile-corrected-frame-23.png)
are retained. Existing cubic/reference images remain valid because their bytes are unchanged.
Further resolve changes await a fresh critique of these measured remaining errors.

Fresh critique identifies lost thin-fence coverage and dark cubic excursions as the largest
remaining problems. The next bounded diagnostic changes only the final cubic+strict blend:
ordinary `mix(clippedHistoryColor, currentColor, currentWeight)` replaces luminance reweighting,
at the identical previously computed current weight. Sampling, clipping, rejection, jitter,
history lifetime and every original quality threshold remain unchanged. Matching never-occluded
and zero-velocity arms accompany it, for 352 frames total. Real pinned-WGSL regression verifies
that the diagnostic removes luminance reweighting and uses the existing weight directly;
omitted and explicit luminance settings compile identically. No default changes.

A new diagnostic records mean linear blue per column over x=165–219/y=140–194, then sums each
column's signed difference from the matching reference background pixel (0,0). All sixteen
profiles are reported without clamping dark deficits. Its
[baseline measured on the existing combined source](../../verification/prd455/fence-profile-baseline.json)
gives frame-28 contrast 3.7238601 for reference, 2.3472733 installed and 2.9720493 cubic+strict.
The arithmetic is documented independently of the critic's unrecorded calculation. The
full-image edge, instability, reveal, causal and excursion measures remain authoritative;
a local contrast improvement alone cannot qualify the candidate. Increased shimmer or bright
halos remain explicit risks. If the deficit does not consistently shrink across the sequence,
reject this hypothesis instead of tuning blend constants. Hosted execution awaits review of
this diagnostic increment; no ordinary-blend image-quality result is claimed yet.
Frozen diagnostic checkpoint: 141 focused tests pass, including actual WGSL generation and
all thirteen generated scaffold hashes. Root types/error-level lint, fixture build, docs,
instruction mirrors and the 71.3 MB evidence budget pass. Full runtime qualification is pending.


### Lifecycle repair preserved in current develop merge (2026-10-04)

The published toggle repair `004e4b8a` removes the chain-owned physical velocity attachment
after invalidating its old GPU targets, preserves borrowed attachments and reattaches the
cached texture on reactivation. Published head `b32342b9` adds only the public type-import fix.
The original hardware three-toggle fixture has no console errors/warnings and is nonblank,
with final targets/history/stages/provisioning zero; its full result remains **failed** because
the unchanged p95 baseline-noise gate is exceeded by +0.625 ms. This does not qualify cost.

The isolated normal merge with develop `15adf350` retains the incoming fluid, exposure/fog,
assets and render-output ownership changes. Frozen install, JavaScript dependency builds,
full workspace TypeScript and 255 focused CPU tests pass; the real Three patch predecessor
regression is fixed with exact full-blob migrations and tamper refusal. The merged runtime
has not been captured. No reconstruction, quality, ghosting, native or performance acceptance
box changes. The original quality failures and diagnostic hypotheses above remain open.


### Rejected input frames invalidate temporal history (2026-10-05)

On published source `ea0c3070`, four CPU lifecycle regressions fail: after a valid
history frame, mismatched depth/velocity dimensions, a missing renderer or a missing
materialized colour input throw before the history-invalidating catch. Restoring
the input then incorrectly reports valid history and skips both current-colour seeds.
The generated helper now includes these guards in its existing failure/reset boundary.
The rejected frame still throws and does not advance its completed-frame report;
the next valid frame reports `scene-reset` and seeds both output and history, then
ordinary accumulation resumes. The six-file temporal/velocity/resolve CPU slice
passes **45/45**; strict TypeScript on the changed helper/spec also passes.
These are CPU contracts with GPU work stubbed. No new runtime screenshot, image-quality,
reconstruction, cost or native qualification is claimed, and no acceptance box changes.


### Current develop CPU and CI integration (2026-10-05)

The normal merge with develop `d5d169705` preserves TS7, exposure and the current
CI receipt policy. Its two conflicts retain this PRD's verified in-progress status
and incoming priority, and recompute all thirteen scaffold hashes from actual generated
projects with the original helper and assertions; all **66 scaffold tests pass**.
The eight-package JavaScript/declaration dependency closure and full workspace TS7
checks pass. Temporal and velocity keep their existing selectors/runtime commands while
using the caller's exact candidate, run/attempt artifact identities and existing receipt
writer/upload; both participate in receipt completion. The four affected integration
contract files pass **259/259**, and fresh independent review accepts the repairs.
These bounded CPU checks do not replace the required hosted board or the original
quality, reconstruction, cost and native evidence. All acceptance boxes remain unchanged.
### Second develop merge into PR #398 (2026-10-04)

The repair lane fast-forwarded from `ffa6ea9bb` to the published head `ea0c30701` with no
history rewritten, then merged `origin/develop` `64aed30fe` (PRD-345 backlight and
dark-environment defaults). One conflict, in `packages/create-threenative/__tests__/
scaffold.spec.ts`: both sides had re-pinned `PRD_201_PARENT_SCAFFOLD_HASHES` for unrelated
reasons, so neither table described the merged tree. The resolution is the merged-tree
measurement through the actual `createProject` trees, and
`vitest run packages/create-threenative/__tests__/scaffold.spec.ts -t byte-stable` passes on
it. The incoming backlight, environment-contribution and material-lighting bytes and the
temporal render source both survive; nothing under `src/render/` moved into a package.

`pnpm ci:fast` passes all four stages: lint, docs, agents mirror and drift (including the full
scaffold spec). The wider `vitest run packages/create-threenative` run is 1272/1282. Its
deterministic reds all name files this merge did not touch and are already red on the
published head: `temporalResolve.ts` at 347 lines, `temporalAA.ts` with no importer and an
uncalled `createTemporalAA`, and the starter `CLAUDE.md` 100-line budget. The rest are
environment reds on an unbuilt checkout: a 60s build ceiling, `publication.spec.ts` missing
`packages/metahuman/dist`, three asset-cook 60s timeouts and one 180s pristine-scaffold
typecheck timeout. No threshold, control or sample count moved.

This merge has no new runtime proof, no capture and no hardware run. Every quality,
ghosting, dynamic-resolution, native and performance acceptance box above stays exactly as it
was, and the p95 baseline-noise control is still unpassed.

### Browser positive is green on the display-sized arm; the cold-frame control is not (2026-10-04)

The browser lane now runs through the harness on the correct HTML entry and the flags this host's
X11 compositor accepts, so the two earlier causes are closed rather than re-diagnosed. The entry is
`/temporal.html?measure&variant=scaled`, not the bare `/temporal-main.js` module URL that rendered as
text and produced `TN_PLAYTEST_BRIDGE_MISSING`. The flags are the six already proved on this
adapter — `--enable-unsafe-webgpu --enable-features=Vulkan --use-angle=vulkan --use-vulkan
--disable-vulkan-surface --no-sandbox` — passed as repeated `--browser-arg`, which is the supported
override and replaces the recipe rather than extending it, so no harness change was needed.

Positive, `examples/abyss-framework/playtests/temporal-aa-scaled.playtest.json` against
`http://127.0.0.1:5199/temporal.html?measure&variant=scaled`: 26 of 26 assertions pass and
diagnostics are empty. Adapter `nvidia`/`turing`, 30 scenario frames, eight declared triviality
opt-outs. Both cold frames compared the full 192 samples at outside 0 — the opening frame at input
853x480 with no lattice (`viewEnabled false`), the resize frame at input 853x320 with
`jitterMatchesInput true` — and both published mean 0.0833 against an oracle mean of 0.0833.

Native positive was re-executed rather than reused, so no stale parity pass covers the new row
wiring: `artifacts/conformance/native-r8/report.json`, `temporal-aa-scaled` pass, native exit 0,
1280x480 non-uniform, `pixelMismatchRatio 0.0413037109375 <= 0.06`, `perceptualDeltaE
0.2009623136688549 <= 9`, zero GPU validation errors, 192 samples per cold frame at outside 0. The
runner exits 2 because the other 96 rows are unselected and one further row is blocked; that exit is
the blocked-row contract, not a failure of the selected row. The native adapter is genuinely
unknown and is reported as such.

The cold-frame control was red in that window, and this paragraph's explanation of it was **wrong**.
It claimed the fixture's constant-valid hook was a silent no-op because Three.js 0.185.1's
`TRAANode.js` has no `_historyValidUniform` member. That member is not upstream's: `temporalAA.ts`
installs it on the node and `temporalResolve.ts` reads it, so
`historyValid.greaterThan(0.5).and(...)` is the live `hasValidHistory` term of the kernel the
provider installs. The gate reaches the shader. What the 8x8 centre block actually showed is weaker:
variance clipping pulls a stale history towards the current neighbourhood, so one flat block of the
frame agreed with the oracle whether or not the gate was installed, and 192 samples could not tell
the two arms apart. The measurement was too small, not inert. The control row and its registry entry
stay uncommitted until the comparison covers the frame.

The fix was not a re-diagnosis of the browser lane and not a new shader seam. It is a wider
measurement: one cold frame's whole published display against the same spatial GPU oracle.

### Two static contracts cleared by a comment-and-spacing repair (2026-10-04)

The generated `temporalResolve.ts` lost its narration comments and their blank spacing, 347 to331
lines, with the MIT notice, the pinned Three.js 0.185.1 attribution and the boundary, citation and
calibration comments kept. `ts.transpileModule` with `removeComments: true` and `sourceMap: false`
emits 9,363 bytes before and after and the two outputs are byte-identical, so the repair changes
no executed statement. The three `temporal-resolve.spec.ts` tests pass.

That repair did not clear the cap and is not claimed to. It bought room, and the resolve equations
were then split into the modules that fit: `temporalAA.ts` 198 lines, `temporalAAFrame.ts` 197,
`temporalAAStage.ts` 52, `temporalResolve.ts` 122, `temporalResolveDepth.ts` 124 and
`temporalResolveMath.ts` 146. Every generated temporal helper is now under 200 lines, so the earlier
`looks.spec.ts` exemption for `temporalResolve.ts` is removed rather than kept. The 200-line cap now
holds for every generated render file except the two named reasons beside it, `loading.ts` and
`worldEnvironment.ts`, and the ownership assertion above them — no `@threenative/` import in any
generated render file — still covers every one of the six.

The starter `AGENTS.md` lost the blank line before each of nine section headings, 97 to 88 lines,
so the generated `CLAUDE.md` mirror measures 91 lines against the 100-line budget. No sentence,
word, reference, convention, temporal note, backlight note or appearance note was removed;
`pnpm sync:agents` rewrote that one mirror and its `--check` reports 22 mirrors in sync.

Focused results on this tree: `looks.spec.ts -t 'should keep generated render files readable and
framework-free'` 1 passed (was red at 347 lines), the whole `looks.spec.ts` 19 passed,
`template.spec.ts -t 'should scaffold flat agent docs without shared marker comments'` 1 passed
(was red at 100 lines), `scaffold.spec.ts -t 'byte-stable'` 1 passed after the measured `starter`
tree hash moved to `f62b055c8c33441007a9bf293427ba88b126cacf44d062d46b17cb1f697c7a88` with the
other twelve unchanged, `pnpm check:docs` clean across 2,442 links, `pnpm typecheck` Done, and
biome reporting one pre-existing `looks.spec.ts:88` complexity warning that is identical at HEAD.
The full `template.spec.ts` run is 56 passed and the same two reds as above: `starter/temporalAA.ts`
has no importer and `createTemporalAA` is uncalled.

No threshold, control, sample count or acceptance box changed, no runtime proof was gathered and
no capture or hardware run was made.

### Native reset/readback proof on the desktop lane (2026-10-04)

`scene-support.js` calls `subject.render()` and never `subject.sampleVelocity()`, so the readbacks
this proof needs could not execute natively. The scene's `build` callback is the supported async
seam — `offscreen-screenshot.js` already reads a render target there — so
`temporal-aa-scaled.js` drives its 22 diagnostic frames inside `build` and asserts every one before
the frame loop starts. No shared harness file changed.

Ran `sh scripts/xvfb.sh node packages/runtime-native/conformance/run-conformance.mjs --target desktop
--only-tests temporal-aa-scaled --reference packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/web --out
artifacts/conformance/native-r7` against the prebuilt `build/tn-linux/mystral`, no C++ change and no
rebuild. Row `temporal-aa-scaled` passed: native exit 0, non-uniform screenshot,
`pixelMismatchRatio` 0.0394287109375 against the 0.06 tolerance, `perceptualDeltaE` 0.24874598761131655
against 9, zero GPU validation errors, 1280x480. The runner exited 2 because the 96 unselected rows
are reported blocked, which the registry requires.

The native adapter identity is not available: the conformance stdout carries no adapter, vendor or
architecture string, so nothing claims hardware here. The host window is 1280x720 and the capture is
1280x480 after the fixture's own height-only resize.

Because the row passed, those assertions held natively: input raster 853x480 then 853x320, depth
history 853x480 then 853x320, display, resolve and history 1280x720 then 1280x480 with the display
width held, the far border of the display raster answering a display-sized resolve, exactly two
compared reset frames, 192 compared samples in each with none outside the spatial oracle, no jitter
lattice on the opening frame, and the resize frame's lattice equal to the input raster. The disabled
gating control (`scaled-unchecked-reset`) did not run natively in this window, so its contamination
is still browser-only.

Browser rerun: red. `temporal-aa-scaled.playtest.json` and its `-unchecked-reset` control both stop
at `TN_PLAYTEST_BRIDGE_MISSING` with `frames: 0`, headed and headless, so the page installs no bridge
under the current fixture. The earlier 26/26 and 5/5 results predate the final fixture, probe and
scenario edits and describe no current tree. `examples/abyss-framework/temporal-main.js` gained the
scaled arms' 1280x720 display raster, `settle` 20 and a 5-frame startup advance to make the browser
control reach the same raster pair; that change is unproved while the scenario is red.

Every full-phase box stays open: rejection, corpus, quality, ghosting, automatic-scale and
performance. No threshold, tolerance or assertion was widened, no capture was taken on hardware and
no commit was made.

### The whole-display cold-frame oracle separates the two arms (2026-10-05)

`temporal-resolve-probe.ts` now compares a cold frame's **whole published display** against the same
immutable-current-input spatial GPU oracle, at the same half-float precision and the same tolerance.
Each readback's row stride is derived from the returned typed array rather than assumed to be its pixel
width, because a GPU readback pads rows to a 256-byte boundary. Precision, thresholds, depth rejection
and variance clipping are untouched; the oracle is still the resolve's own colour sample of the same
input texture, rendered by the same state discipline at display size.

Browser, the two proved entries and the six proved flags, adapter `nvidia`/`turing`:

- Positive `temporal-aa-scaled`: **29 of 29 assertions pass**, diagnostics empty, 30 scenario frames,
  nine triviality opt-outs. Both cold frames report `outside 0` with `worstRatio 0` over the whole
  display — **2,764,800** channels at 1280x720 and **1,843,200** at 1280x480 — with published mean
  0.0336 against oracle mean 0.0336 and 0.0277 against 0.0277. `artifacts/playtest/wholeframe-positive`.
- Control `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset`: **8 of 8 assertions pass** on the identical sample
  sets, `outside` **168,884** of 2,764,800 (`worstRatio` 898.096) at the opening reset and **119,914**
  of 1,843,200 (`worstRatio` 959.5) at the resize reset. `artifacts/playtest/wholeframe-control`.

So the reset gate is live and now carries weight: with the whole frame compared, the gated arm
publishes the untouched input everywhere and the ungated arm publishes an unwritten history over
6.1% and 6.5% of the frame. Both browser scenarios and both native scenes now assert
`pixels === width * height * 3` on each cold frame instead of the 8x8 block's 192.

Focused units stay green: `temporal-resolve.spec.ts`, `temporal-aa.spec.ts`, `looks.spec.ts` and
`scaffold.spec.ts` pass, 104 tests in 7.26 s.

**Native is not re-executed in this window, and the reason is a blocker, not a pass.** Generating the
fresh browser reference both native rows require fails on the positive row, deterministically, in three
consecutive runs — twice with the control in the same run and once with the row alone
(`packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/web-wholeframe-r1`, `web-wholeframe-r2`,
`web-posonly-r3`): the probe's
pre-existing raster guard throws `Resolve must hold the display raster; it is 1280x720 against
1280x480` at the fixture's height-only transition, so that row writes no reference capture and the
desktop lane has nothing to compare against. The control row passes the same frames and captures
1280x480. `guardRasters` runs before any comparison this window changed, so the cause is not yet
diagnosed; what it is not is a product claim either way. The earlier `native-r8` positive pass
compared the 8x8 block and describes no longer-current measurement, so it does not carry over. No
native row, adapter identity or hardware claim is recorded here.

Every full-phase box stays open: rejection, corpus, quality, ghosting, automatic-scale and
performance. No threshold, tolerance or assertion was widened, no capture was taken on hardware and
nothing is committed: the normal hook commit needs all four lanes green and only the two browser
lanes are.

### The blocked native reference was a missing frame boundary in the scene (2026-10-05)

The blocker above is a fixture-scheduling defect, in the conformance scene, not a product defect and
not a measurement defect. Both diagnostic frames ran back to back inside one turn: the loop issued
`fixture.render()` and then awaited only `fixture.sampleVelocity()`, which is a GPU-completion
await, not a frame boundary. `temporal-main.js` already carries the reason — a temporal node's own
frame update waits on the animation clock, so renders issued without one never advance it. At the
height-only transition the resolve therefore still held the pre-resize display raster, and the
probe's pre-existing `guardRasters` threw `it is 1280x720 against 1280x480` before any comparison.

The fix is one line in each of `temporal-aa-scaled.js` and `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset.js`,
reusing the advance already proven in this directory's `probe-volume-sample.js`:
`await new Promise((resolve) => requestAnimationFrame(resolve))` before each diagnostic render. No
new helper, file, dependency or product change, no guard, threshold, tolerance or assertion touched,
and both arms keep the identical 22-frame loop so they stay one frame-for-frame pair. The browser
lane's Chromium already carries `--enable-unsafe-webgpu --enable-features=Vulkan` in
`run-conformance.mjs`, so the reference needs no extra flag route; the repeated `--browser-arg` form
belongs to the direct playtest CLI and was used there.

All four runtime arms, on this exact tree:

- Browser positive **29 of 29**, adapter `nvidia`/`turing`, `outside 0` and `worstRatio 0` over the
  whole display at **2,764,800** and **1,843,200** channels — identical to the run above, because the
  browser fixture did not change. `artifacts/playtest/raf-positive`.
- Browser control **8 of 8**, `outside` **168,884** (`worstRatio` 898.096) and **119,914**
  (`worstRatio` 959.5) on the same channel counts. `artifacts/playtest/raf-control`.
- Fresh web reference, adapter `nvidia`/`turing`, both rows pass at display 1280x480, no page errors
  and no GPU validation error. `packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/web-raf-r9/report.json`.
- Native desktop, prebuilt `build/tn-linux/mystral`, no C++ rebuild: both rows pass, native exit 0,
  zero GPU validation errors, non-uniform 1280x480. `temporal-aa-scaled`
  `pixelMismatchRatio 0.0350537109375 <= 0.06`, `perceptualDeltaE 0.2504743023768323 <= 9`;
  `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset` `0.045857747395833336 <= 0.06`, `0.19054617552811 <= 9`.
  `packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/native-raf-r9/report.json`. The runner exits 2
  because the other 96 registry rows are unselected; that is the blocked-row contract. The native
  adapter remains genuinely unknown and is reported as unknown, not inferred from the browser row.
- `biome check` clean on both scenes; `pnpm check:docs` clean across 2,442 links; the 104 focused
  unit tests were green before this window and this change touches no unit-covered source.

No full CI, no push, no merge. Every full-phase box stays open: rejection, corpus, quality,
ghosting, automatic-scale and performance.

### The per-pixel rejection fraction is measured on both lanes (2026-10-06)

`ITemporalAAReport` now carries a measured `rejection`, and the report is the only place a caller
reads it. `temporalResolveDepth.ts` lifts the one history-validity decision — `historyValid ∧
validUV ∧ (edge ∨ ¬disocclusion)` — into a single `historyValidity` node parameterised by the
pixel's UV. `temporalResolve.ts` calls that node for the blend weight, so the appearance is
untouched: no new gate, no control uniform, no colour alpha. `temporalRejectionCounter.ts` calls the
*same* node once per display pixel from a compute dispatch, `atomicAdd`s the rejected and visited
words into a two-word `instancedArray`, and copies them back asynchronously, one at a time. A
reported fraction therefore cannot describe a different decision than the one the resolve drew,
because there is only one decision node. The dispatch runs between the resolve draw and this frame's
depth-history copy, so the kernel reads the depth and matrices the resolve just drew with; nothing is
re-rendered and no `PassTexture` dependency is added, so no input changes.

Fail-closed on purpose: a copy that never lands, lands short, lands with `visited ≠` the display, or
lands with `rejected >` `visited` **withdraws** the measurement and records the reason. `settled()`
rejects with that reason, `report()` omits the field, and `drain()` hands the chain nothing — never a
zero, never the previous frame's number. The report field is omitted rather than set to `undefined`,
which a real failure caught: the playtest bridge publishes a resource whole and rejects
`undefined` as not JSON-safe. `chain.observeFrame()` then fails closed on its own terms too — a
non-advancing frame, a non-finite share or a share outside `[0, 1]` throws — and an unlanded
measurement is reported as absent, never as `0`.

`temporalAAHooks.ts` (51 lines) owns the two pipeline callbacks separately, and the lifecycle
decision is unchanged: both originals are captured **once, before** upstream's setup writes the
node's own pair; our `before` is installed after setup alongside the owned upstream `after`; the
jitter callback keeps one identity across recompiles; and `dispose()` restores **both** first
originals only while each slot still holds what this node installed, so a later replacement survives.
Three tests prove the restore, the recompile identity and the later-owner case.

Files: `temporalAA.ts` (report field, shared rejection instance, hook install), `temporalAAFrame.ts`
(dispatch between resolve and depth copy, dispose the counter), `temporalAAStage.ts` (publish the
callback the chain asks for), `temporalResolveDepth.ts` (the shared node), `temporalResolve.ts` (call
site), `temporalAAHooks.ts`, `temporalRejectionCounter.ts`, the canonical `worldEnvironment.ts` and
its twelve copies, and `temporal-aa-fixture.js` (`settledRejection()` then `chain.observeFrame()`).

**Capability audit actually run before this work**, through the registered `engine-mcp`
implementation (`packages/engine-mcp/dist/index.js`, `searchCapabilities` + `capabilityDetail`), not a
filtered read of the manifest: two queries — one on owning pipeline callbacks around a third-party
node that writes the same callbacks during setup, one on measuring the rejected-history share on the
GPU with an asynchronous readback — returned **25 hits** and `engine_capability_detail` ran on every
one. The hits that decided the design: **`GPUReadback`** (one copy in flight, requests during one
dropped rather than queued, every sample carries `staleFrames`, WebGPU-only) — it is the exact
throttle the counter implements by hand, and it is not reachable from generated `src/render/`, which
may import no `@threenative/`; **`velocityTexture`** (`VelocityTracker.update()` before the render,
`commit()` after) — already what the fixture does; **`temporalReproject`** — rejected, an addon that
owns the look. No capability ships a rejection counter, so the count kernel is new generated source,
not core. Zero core changes, zero new dependencies, no generic manager.

Results on this tree, adapter `nvidia`/`turing` in both browser lanes, no SwiftShader:

- Units: **58** focused create-threenative tests pass (25 in `temporal-aa.spec.ts`, including the
  callback lifecycle and the fail-closed recovery cases), plus `scaffold.spec.ts` **66** and
  `shared-render-sources` / `looks` / `temporal-resolve` / `temporal-initial-projection` green.
  `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` exit 0 (Biome warnings only), `pnpm check:docs` clean across
  2,442 links, and every changed generated file is under the 200-line gate after Biome.
- Browser positive **passes** on `temporal.html?measure&variant=scaled`: reset frames at frame 1 and
  frame 21 report fraction **1** with the GPU's own visited count **921,600** (1280×720) and
  **614,400** (1280×480); the 33 warm frames range **0 … 0.006279296875**; the settled
  `aa.rejection` is frame 35 at `0.0014860026041666667` with `staleFrames 0`; the whole-display
  oracle is unchanged at **2,764,800 / 1,843,200** channels, `outside 0`, `worstRatio 0`.
  `artifacts/playtest/rej-positive`.
- Browser control **passes** on `…&variant=scaled-unchecked-reset`: the same counter visits the same
  **921,600 / 614,400** pixels, its cold fractions are **0.92068359375** and **0** — not 1 — and the
  contaminated oracle is unchanged at **168,884 / 119,914**. So the positive row's `1` is the reset
  gate, not a constant. `artifacts/playtest/rej-control`.
- Fresh web reference, both rows **pass**, adapter `nvidia`/`turing`, no page errors, no GPU
  validation error. `packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/web-rej-r2/report.json`.
- Native desktop against that reference, prebuilt `build/tn-linux/mystral` with no C++ rebuild: both
  rows **pass**, native exit 0, zero GPU validation errors, non-uniform 1280x480.
  `temporal-aa-scaled` `pixelMismatchRatio 0.03699544270833333 <= 0.06`,
  `perceptualDeltaE 0.23186547772174834 <= 9`; `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset`
  `0.043798828125 <= 0.06`, `0.24407629667666397 <= 9`.
  `packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/native-rej-r2/report.json`. The runner exits 2
  because the other 96 registry rows are unselected, which is the blocked-row contract. The native
  adapter is genuinely unrecorded by this harness and is reported as unknown, not inferred.
- One defect this window found and fixed, in the fixture rather than the product: the cold-frame
  visited check indexed the observation array by reset index, and the two resets land on diagnostic
  frames 0 and 20, so reset 1 was compared against the pre-resize 1280×720 raster. The counted
  display now travels with the row it describes.

Both Phase 1 boxes are now ticked: the output-size half by the low-resolution-passthrough mutation at
`32ec88d10`, and the cut/projection/resize half by the native lifecycle row below. Phases 2 and 3 stay
open. That entry's own scoped commit was: no full CI, no push, no merge.

### The history coordinate is measured from the continuous current projection (2026-10-05)

`reprojectedHistory()` was wrong twice, and each error alone made its bound unreachable. Its y sign
was inverted. TRAANode samples `historyUV = uv - velocity * vec2( 0.5, - 0.5 )`, and that `uv`
counts raster rows from the top, so a point whose measured NDC delta is `vy` is sampled half its
height *down* the current row: `historyY = currentY + vy*h/2`, never minus. Its anchor was wrong
too. It received the `Math.floor` of the **jittered** draw projection and compared that integer
texel with a continuous unjittered previous location under a 0.05-pixel bound, so the sub-pixel
jitter itself was charged as misregistration.

`packages/runtime-native/conformance/scenes/shared/temporal-velocity-probe.ts` now projects each
tracked point through both matrices. The jittered one still names the MRT texel that is read, and
the unjittered one — the same projection `projectedMotion()` already used — supplies the single
continuous anchor that `measuredPixels`, `expectedPixels` and `misregistrationPixels` are all
measured from. The expected side is still two independently projected positions, so no expected
value is derived from the measured vector. The integer pair stays in the sample as the record of
where the read happened, and `REPROJECTION_PIXELS` stays **0.05**; no threshold moved and no core
file changed.

The derivation is closed in the unit test rather than in prose. On an 800×400 raster a point at
`[400, 200]` whose previous projection was NDC `[-0.1, -0.1]` previously projected to `[360, 220]`
and its measured `[0.1, 0.1]` velocity now reprojects to the same pixel, so the error is 0; the
same point with a zero vector stays at `[400, 200]` and misses by `hypot( 40, 20 )`, more than the
40 pixels that separate it; a point that rose alone, previous NDC `[0, -0.2]` with velocity
`[0, 0.2]`, lands on `[400, 240]` from both sides.

Capability lookup ran before the helper changed, through `packages/engine-mcp/dist/index.js`:
`engine_search_capabilities` plus `engine_capability_detail` on **all 10 hits** across two queries.
Nothing ships a history-coordinate helper; `temporalReproject` is an addon that owns the look, and
`readVelocityPreviousMatrices` is the tracker the fixture already calls. The owned installed Three
0.185.1 was read, not patched: `packages/core/node_modules/three/examples/jsm/tsl/display/TRAANode.js`
lines 664-668 for the sample and `packages/core/node_modules/three/src/nodes/accessors/VelocityNode.js`
line 177 for `velocity = ndcCurrent - ndcPrevious`.

Results on this tree, adapter `nvidia`/`turing` in every browser lane, no SwiftShader:

- Units: **4/4** in `packages/runtime-native/__tests__/temporal-velocity-probe.spec.ts`, which loads
  the shared probe source and is what typechecks it. `pnpm typecheck` exit 0, `pnpm lint` exit 0
  (Biome warnings only, and the 4 complexity warnings on these shared files are already at HEAD).
- Browser positive **passes**, 41/41 assertions, 0 diagnostics, on
  `temporal.html?measure&variant=scaled-lifecycle` at frame 39 with **5** resets. The history
  witness, taken on the 34 frames that reused history, peaks at **0.001587 px** for the rigid body
  (frame 11), **0.001322 px** for the instance (frame 7) and **0.017778 px** for the skinned limb
  (frame 5), against a 0.05-pixel bound, while the measured motion on those same points reaches
  3.124, 1.876 and 0.705 px. The bound is therefore met with real sub-pixel motion underneath it, not
  by dropping frames.
- Browser negative **fails as required**: the same scenario and the same 41 assertions on
  `variant=scaled-lifecycle-zero`, which merges the real scene MRT to `vec2(0)`, exits 1 with 7
  failures and every one of them a history assertion. `maxMisregistration` is **1.876 px** for the
  instance, **0.702 px** for the skinned limb and **3.124 px** for the rigid body, each equal to that
  point's whole per-frame motion, while `maxMeasuredPixels` is **0** and `movingFrames` **0** for all
  three. Expected motion is non-empty in the control (`maxExpectedPixels` 1.876 and 0.702), so the
  failure cannot be read as "nothing moved". Reset count, reset reasons, cold fractions, whole-display
  oracle, rasters, applied stages and `velocity.source mrt` all pass unchanged, and no console or
  network error is reported.
- Browser baseline control **passes**, 35/35 on `playtests/temporal-aa-scaled.playtest.json` with
  `?measure&variant=scaled`, so the shared fixture change costs the existing scaled arm nothing. Its
  witness peaks at the same three values, which is the determinism the route depends on.

The second Phase 1 box stays **open**: `conformance/scenes/shared/temporal-aa-lifecycle.js`, the
deterministic node-side fixture that asserts the same route with `assertCondition`, is written but
has not run on the native lane, and the native registration and capture are the next job. Phases 2
and 3 stay open. Scoped commit only: no full CI, no push, no merge.

### The same lifecycle route now runs natively, and the zero-velocity mutant fails there (2026-10-05)

The browser lane already measured this route and its zero control. `conformance/scenes/shared/
temporal-aa-lifecycle.js` had never run on the native lane, so it is now registered as the row
`temporal-aa-lifecycle`: the existing `.06` mismatch / `9` DeltaE budget, the existing `webgpu`
recipe, `captureFrames 40` for the 36 diagnostic frames, no new tolerance and no new scene. One
defect surfaced on the first browser reference attempt and is fixed here rather than worked around:
`assertRejectionCounts` was hard-coded to the scaled rows' two-reset pair, so the lifecycle route's
five resets failed on its metadata. It now takes the expected count (default 2, unchanged for both
existing callers) and names every counted reset frame by its own recorded `resetReason`.

The route's own assertions are reordered, with no threshold moved. The independent expected motion of
both witnesses comes first, then every tracked object's misregistration in one fail-closed condition,
then the measured-velocity guards. A history coordinate in the wrong place now fails on the history
condition itself, with the point's own independently projected motion in the message, instead of on a
later report of no measured velocity.

Capability lookup ran before the change, through `packages/engine-mcp/dist/index.js`:
`engine_search_capabilities` plus `engine_capability_detail` on **all 10 hits** across two queries.
Nothing ships a history-witness helper or a conformance-registration manager; `temporalReproject` is
again the addon that owns the look, and the registry is the registration mechanism.

Results on this tree, `build/tn-linux/mystral` unchanged, no C++ rebuild:

- Web reference, three selected rows, all **pass**, adapter `nvidia`/`turing`, no page errors and no
  GPU validation error. `packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/web-life-r2/report.json`.
- Native desktop against that reference, all three rows **pass**, native `exitCode 0`, 1280x480,
  non-uniform, zero GPU validation errors. `temporal-aa-lifecycle` `pixelMismatchRatio 0.05384440104166666
  <= 0.06` and `perceptualDeltaE 0.3712519114254307 <= 9`; `temporal-aa-scaled` `0.03699544270833333`
  and `0.23186547772174834`; `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset` `0.04711588541666667` and
  `0.27938254102333937`. `packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/native-life-r1/report.json`.
  The runner exits 2 because the other 96 rows are unselected, which is the blocked-row contract. The
  native adapter is genuinely unrecorded by this harness and is reported as unknown, never inferred
  from the browser row.
- Native negative, same case and same positive web reference, with **only** the `startScene` variant
  string mutated to `scaled-lifecycle-zero`: the row **fails** as required, native `exitCode null`,
  zero GPU validation errors, and the native host's own captured message is
  `temporal lifecycle: the instance missed its independently projected previous location by
  1.6807242909818703 px at frame 2, over the 0.05 px bound, while the point moved 1.6807242909818703
  px; the skinned missed its independently projected previous location by 0.6284101079565797 px at
  frame 2, over the 0.05 px bound, while the point moved 0.6284101079565797 px.`
  `artifacts/conformance/native-life-zero-r1/report.json`. The runner records no stdout or stderr for
  a scene-level assertion, so the message above was read from the same prebuilt binary run directly
  on the harness's own mutant bundle in `artifacts/conformance/desktop-bundles/`. The mutant's exact
  source bytes were restored and verified by hash before this commit; no second registered scene and
  no looser control wrapper exists.
- Browser arms on the same tree, adapter `nvidia`/`turing`: lifecycle positive **41 of 41** with
  empty diagnostics, the lifecycle zero control **fails with 7 history assertions** (all
  `maxMisregistration`, `movingFrames` and `maxMeasuredPixels` for both tracked objects plus the
  rigid witness) and non-empty expected motion, and `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset` **10 of 10**
  with empty diagnostics.
- Focused checks: `packages/runtime-native/__tests__/temporal-velocity-probe.spec.ts` 4 passed,
  `pnpm typecheck` exit 0, `pnpm check:docs` clean across 2,442 links, and Biome clean on both scenes
  and the registry. No generated render file changed, so no scaffold hash moved.

Both Phase 1 boxes are now ticked. Phases 2 and 3 stay open: PRD-269's ghosting and cost controls,
the content corpus and every performance box are untouched. Scoped commit only: no full CI, no push,
no merge.

### The unsupported control counter is now reported unavailable, and the quality family runs natively (2026-10-05)

**The honesty defect.** The `unchecked-history` control installs its 0.05-current / 0.95-history
blend by replacing `temporal.node._resolveMaterial.colorNode` *after* setup. That fragment never
evaluates the shared history-validity predicate, so it bypasses depth rejection, neighbourhood
clipping and motion reprojection at once. The provider's GPU counter kept counting that predicate
anyway, and the harness collected `rejectionFrames` for every temporal role including this one. Its
published share therefore described a decision those pixels did not make — a number that read as a
measurement and was not one. The production and default arms were never affected: their fragment is
the instrumented one, so their counter is real and is kept.

**The fix, at the fixture only.** `temporal-aa-fixture.js` classifies the one policy that replaces
the fragment, and for that arm alone (a) the provider's report copy drops `rejection` and carries
`rejectionUnavailable` with the reason, keeping its source frame, history validity and both rasters;
(b) the RenderChain `rejectionMeasurement` compatibility callback returns `undefined`, so the chain
records no measurement for it; and (c) the collected counter trace skips it. `TemporalRejectionCounter`,
the generated `temporalAA` provider and the `.05`/`.95` blend are untouched, and no public API or
option was added to instrument this mutant. The scorer's assertion is now three-way: an off role has
no resolve, the fragment-overridden control has an explicitly-unavailable counter, and **every other
temporal arm must still publish a real one** — a default sample that went missing fails rather than
passing as unavailable. Its published `counters[variant]` is an object naming the reason instead of
a series, and `method.counterAvailability` states the classification in the summary itself.

**The new native quality row.** `temporal-aa-quality` runs `createTemporalAAFixture` with
`quality-temporal`, `measurement` and `settle 36`, awaiting a real RAF and the diagnostic
`sampleVelocity` each of 36 frames, on the shared fixture with the shared `assertRejectionCounts`.
It asserts the six alpha-tested foliage cards at `alphaTest 0.5` from the 16x16 DataTexture, an input
raster at the authored 2/3 floor strictly below the display, an output at the physical display, the
single `traa` stage with its MRT velocity source, a counter that visited the whole display with a
finite source age, and one reset (startup only, no global reset after it). It reuses the existing
`.06` / `9` budget, the `webgpu` recipe and `captureFrames 40`; no tolerance was loosened and no new
runner or harness wrapper exists. It proves runtime portability and counter truth on the native host
only. It proves no image-quality gate, and no such claim is made.

Capability lookup ran before the change, through `packages/engine-mcp/dist/index.js`:
`engine_search_capabilities` plus `engine_capability_detail` on **all 18 hits** across five queries.
Nothing ships an unavailable-measurement convention for a fixture report, a quality-corpus scene or a
conformance-registration manager, so the classification stays a fixture-local helper over the existing
provider API.

Results on this tree, `build/tn-linux/mystral` unchanged, no C++ rebuild:

- **Browser, all 31 arms re-captured** after the honesty fix, adapter `nvidia`/`turing`,
  `rendererKind webgpu`, zero error diagnostics. **All 31 arms' colour bytes are byte-identical to
  the previous baseline** (every frame 21–36 sha256 matches), which is the expected result: the fix
  removes a published measurement, not a pixel. `artifacts/temporal-aa/motion/summary.json`.
  `temporal` and `quality-temporal` still publish 36 real frames each — `fraction 0.0030772569444444445`
  and `0.011046006944444445`, `visited 230400`, `staleFrames 0` — and the four
  `unchecked-history` arms now publish `{unavailable: "fragment-overridden control bypasses the
  instrumented rejection predicate"}`. Every `checks` value is **identical** to the previous run;
  `edgeImprovement`, `revealRecovery`, `qualityEdgeImprovement` and `qualityRevealRecovery` stay red,
  so both Phase 2 boxes stay open. The runner exits 1 on those four gates, which is the expected
  negative result; no assertion was dropped to make it green.
- Web reference for the four temporal rows, all **pass** (scaled 4.4s, unchecked-reset 3.6s,
  lifecycle 4.8s, quality 5.0s), runner exit 2 for the 96 unselected rows.
  `packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/web-quality-r1/report.json`.
- Native desktop against that same reference: `temporal-aa-quality` **pass** —
  `pixelMismatchRatio 0.04682942708333333 <= 0.06`, `perceptualDeltaE 0.15945597590657543 <= 9`, at
  the native 1280x720 display with its 853x480 input. `temporal-aa-scaled` `0.0385888671875`,
  `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset` `0.049832356770833336`, both pass. Reproduced identically on
  a second run. `artifacts/conformance/native-quality-r2/` and `-r3/report.json`. The native adapter
  is genuinely unrecorded by this harness and is reported as unknown, never inferred from the browser
  row.
- **`temporal-aa-lifecycle` fails on this reference at `0.061551106770833333 > 0.06`**, DeltaE
  `0.40011787108055263`, `failureReason` "Capture metrics exceeded the registry tolerance", with zero
  GPU validation errors. This is **reference variance, not a regression from this change**, and the
  measurement says so: the native capture is **byte-identical** to the run that passed
  (`0.00000` mismatch, same md5) between `native-life-r1` and `native-quality-r2`. The prior green at
  `0.05384440104166666` came from a different reference (`web-life-r2`).
  **Correction to the claim first written here.** That entry said the two browser references of the
  same scene "differ from each other by `0.03870`" and therefore that "two correct browser runs
  disagree by more than the whole row's budget". Both clauses were false. `0.03870` is the gap
  between the two browser captures, which is *inside* the `0.06` budget — it is a real contribution
  to the paired comparison, not an amount that exceeds the budget on its own. The paired
  web-to-native comparison is what exceeds budget, and it does so because the browser and native
  contributions point in the same direction and add up. The claim also named the jitter lattice as
  the mechanism; that stayed a hypothesis and the trace below refuted it. With the tolerance
  unchanged at `.06`, the row is left failing and reported.
- Focused checks: `pnpm typecheck` exit 0; Biome clean on both scenes and the scorer. The fixture's
  pre-existing cognitive-complexity warning is unchanged at 21 and the repo's one native-smoke physics
  complexity warning is untouched — neither is fixed in this scope.

No core, API, generic counter or ledger change. No generated render file changed, so no scaffold hash
moved. Scoped commit only: no full CI, no push, no merge.

### The capture repeatability defect, traced (2026-10-05)

**The red check, run before any edit.** Two fresh web captures of the four temporal rows on this
exact tree and commit, `web-rep-r1` and `web-rep-r2`, adapter `nvidia`/`turing`, all four rows pass,
runner exit 2 for the 96 unselected rows. Their own capture bytes do **not** agree:

| Row | r1 vs r2 capture mismatch | max channel delta |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `temporal-aa-scaled` | 21,651 px, `0.035239` | 84 |
| `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset` | 23,431 px, `0.038136` | 96 |
| `temporal-aa-lifecycle` | 0 px, byte-identical | 0 |
| `temporal-aa-quality` | 0 px, byte-identical | 0 |

So the defect is not web-versus-native and not a regression from the honesty fix: the **same host
disagrees with itself run to run**, and it does so on the two rows whose budget the failing
lifecycle row was being blamed on. Across all seven preserved capture sets the rows hold
`scaled` 5 distinct states, `scaled-unchecked-reset` 5, `lifecycle` 3, `quality` 2. A row that can
only be compared byte-for-byte is not a conformance row.

**The jitter-lattice hypothesis is not refuted by the bounded diff.** The prior entry attributed the
disagreement to the capture landing on a jitter-lattice frame boundary. The fixture already freezes
the authored pose (`pose = min(frame, settle)`), so a whole-image lattice-phase shift is not the
cause: the differing pixels are a *bounded region*, not a whole-image sub-pixel shift. That bounds the
mechanism without excluding jitter, which can still decide the pixels inside a bounded region. For `scaled` the diff is confined
to `x 430-840, y 169-361` of 1280x480; for `lifecycle`, `x 313-751, y 163-375`. That is the footprint
of the fixture's own `occluder` (`occluder.visible = frame < 28`), the saturated foreground plane
that is removed without a reset so the history must resolve the disocclusion on its own. Everything
outside that box is byte-identical.

**What the fixture actually does after settle, and why the capture is not a fixed point.** Traced
`scene-support.js` → `temporal-aa-fixture.js` → the provider and the two capture drivers:

1. `startVisualScene` calls `subject.render()` once, then drives an endless
   `requestAnimationFrame` loop. The fixture's `render()` keeps running after the diagnostic frames
   and after `settle`, and the pose freeze holds only the *authored* transforms.
2. The temporal resolve keeps running on that frozen pose. Its history still carries the occluder's
   disocclusion, and the neighbourhood clip and depth rejection blend the old samples out over
   successive frames **asymptotically**. There is no frame at which the history is exactly settled,
   so a capture's pixel values depend on how many frames elapsed since the last authored change.
3. Nothing pins that frame count. The browser driver screenshots the canvas element after
   `captureFrames` rAFs; the native host services a screenshot request from whichever presented
   frame answers the mailbox poll. Either can land one frame earlier or later, and one frame is
   enough to move 3.5% of the pixels inside the occluder's box.

So the jitter lattice was never the variable. The variable is the **decay of temporal history in a
region the fixture deliberately disoccluded, sampled at an unpinned frame index.**

**Why no repair was made in that entry.** The two repairs named there both destroy what
the row measures, and both are out of bounds for this scope:

- A per-frame history reset after settle would pin the pixels, but it is exactly the
  `unchecked-reset` control the positive row exists to contrast against, and it would publish a cold
  frame as the capture — the row would compare two reset frames and stop testing reconstruction.
- Pinning the capture frame in the harness would need the browser compositor and the native present
  boundary to agree on a frame index, which is a runner change, and the scope forbids a new runner or
  API for this.

The honest statement of where this stands: the failing `lifecycle` number is a **real** failure of a
row that is **not** deterministic, and the `.06` budget was never shown to be wrong. The next task
should decide whether the fixture's disocclusion is authored to settle on a frame it can name, or
whether the capture driver must be frame-locked. Until one of those lands, this PRD does not claim
`prd:100%` for Phase 1: the native repeatability failure stands open.

### A third repair the previous entry ruled out by omission: hold the finished frame (2026-10-06)

**Correction.** The previous entry claimed the only two repairs were a per-frame history reset and a
harness frame lock, and closed Phase 1 as unfixable in scope. That claim was wrong: a third repair
exists, and it changes nothing the row measures. After a route's diagnostics finish, the fixture
retains the resolve target its last real frame actually produced and presents *that same texture* on
every later frame. No scene pass, no velocity, no reconstruction and no history write runs again, so
no diagnostic frame, rejection count, reset reason or raster is invented by presenting, and the
fixture's own metadata stays on the last frame it really rendered. Each presentation frame is still a
genuine draw to the host surface.

Implemented as one fixture-local `freeze()` on the shared temporal fixture
(`packages/runtime-native/conformance/scenes/shared/temporal-aa-fixture.js`), called once by the four
capture routes (`scaled`, `scaled-unchecked-reset`, `lifecycle`, `quality`) after all their existing
diagnostic renders, readbacks and assertions, before returning to `startVisualScene`. It fails closed:
freezing twice, freezing with no reconstruction frame, or freezing a resolve that is not the display
raster throws. The default `temporal-aa` row, the browser `temporal-main` measurement with
`settle === null`, every other variant, all 200 generated capabilities and all 200 capabilities of the
manifest are untouched. No core, runner, C++, dependency, threshold or appearance policy changed.

**Measured, this commit, local desktop host.** Every run used `--only-tests` on the same four rows and
the runner exited `2` for the 96 unselected rows (blocked, never passed).

| Comparison | Result |
| --- | --- |
| web r1 vs web r2, all four rows | **byte-identical PNG** (`sha256` equal) |
| native r1 vs native r2, all four rows | **byte-identical PNG** (`sha256` equal) |
| web r1 vs native r1, all four rows | `pixelMismatchRatio 0`, `perceptualDeltaE 0` |
| web r2 vs native r2, all four rows | `pixelMismatchRatio 0`, `perceptualDeltaE 0` |

Independently re-checked outside the runner by decoding both PNG sets: max channel delta `0` for every
row, web against native and native against native. The runner's `0/0` is not a self-comparison: the
web and native PNG files have different bytes and different sizes on disk, and the decode compares the
pixels. Before this repair the same table read `scaled` 21,651 px / `0.035239` and
`scaled-unchecked-reset` 23,431 px / `0.038136` run to run, and `lifecycle` `0.061551106770833333 >
0.06` web against native. No reference, warmup, capture frame or tolerance was changed to reach these
numbers; the captured frame is the same authored final diagnostic frame each route already rendered
(frame 22 on the two scaled rows, frame 36 on `lifecycle` and `quality`), never a later 64 or 300.

Zero GPU validation errors, no device loss and no adapter fallback in either native log. The native
adapter is unrecorded by this harness and stays unknown. The web adapter is not written into these
four runs' reports, so this entry claims no browser adapter identity rather than inferring one.
Artifacts: `packages/runtime-native/artifacts/conformance/pr398-freeze-{web-r1,web-r2,native-r1,native-r2}/`.

**Where this leaves the PRD.** Phase 1's native gate is now green on all four rows at `0` mismatch, so
the earlier open repeatability failure is closed by measurement rather than by relaxing a budget. The
rest is unchanged and still open: the Phase 2 quality scores and their gates, the Phase 3 GPU/render
p95 comparison, and the PRD-269 ghosting cost remain as they were. This repair makes the capture a
fixed point; it does not measure temporal stability, and it says nothing about the 176-frame quality
benchmark. The `.03870` correction above stands as written.

### Hand the replaced context back to its own originals (2026-10-06)

**The bug.** `temporalAAHooks.ts` captured the two pipeline callback slots once, from the first
context it ever saw, and restored them only on `dispose()`. Three.js 0.185.1's
`RenderPipeline._update` builds a **fresh** context object on every recompile and `pipeline.context`
names the active one. So after a recompile the node's `before`/`after` pair sat on the context three
had stopped calling, the new context kept the originals **and** nothing of ours, and `dispose()`
restored a slot nobody called while the live pair stayed installed — a disposed node that still
jittered and re-projected the camera. The helper also captured `before`/`after` once for all
contexts, so the originals it would later restore were the *first* context's, not the replaced one's.

**The repair.** One local `restore()`, called both when `captureBeforeSetup` sees a different context
and from `dispose()`. It writes each slot back only while that slot still holds what this node
installed, so a later owner survives and upstream's pair is left to the node being disposed. The
capture guard becomes `if (context === next) return`, so the same context still preserves the first
originals and a new context captures **its** originals before upstream's setup runs. Generated
template source, starter only: the canonical helper is ~65 lines and only the starter tree carries
it, so no template was copied blind and `scaffold.spec.ts`'s measured starter hash is the only one
that moves (`89dd12f6971111bc16476a884baa7bcf76e4b3b08fe7c66b073f09dfe28a1c78`).

**Red then green, actual exits.** Two new cases in `temporal-aa.spec.ts` failed first: the replaced
context still held `OLD` and `NEW` after `dispose()`. After the repair:
`pnpm exec vitest run packages/create-threenative/__tests__/{scaffold,temporal-aa,temporal-resolve,temporal-initial-projection}.spec.ts packages/core/__tests__/temporal-chain.spec.ts packages/runtime-native/__tests__/temporal-velocity-probe.spec.ts`
→ `6 files, 111 tests passed`, exit `0`. `pnpm typecheck` exit `0`, `biome check` on the three
touched files exit `0`.

**Browser scenarios, this commit, actual exits.** The three existing scenarios ran unmodified against
`examples/abyss-framework` at variant `scaled-lifecycle`, `scaled` and `scaled-unchecked-reset`,
adapter `nvidia`/`turing`, `rendererKind webgpu`, fixed-step clock, zero console/network/runtime
diagnostics: `temporal-aa-lifecycle` **41** assertions pass exit `0`, `temporal-aa-scaled` **35**
pass exit `0`, `temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset` **10** pass exit `0`. The blocked runs before this
were the harness, not the game: Vite 8.2.0 binds `[::1]` only, so `http://127.0.0.1:5201` was
refused (`curl` `000`) while `localhost` answered `200`. The managed server now passes
`--host 127.0.0.1 --port 5201 --strictPort`, which is what the repo's own
`playtest:loading-leak` script already did. No budget, assertion or threshold moved.

**Native, fresh web reference, actual exits.** Both lanes ran the same four rows with
`--only-tests temporal-aa-scaled,temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset,temporal-aa-lifecycle,temporal-aa-quality`
against the prebuilt `build/tn-linux/mystral` (no rebuild): web **4 pass / 0 fail**, exit `2`;
desktop against the fresh web directory **4 pass / 0 fail**, exit `2`. Exit `2` is the 96 unselected
rows, each recorded `blocked` with reason `Not selected by this bounded execution run.` — not a
failure and not a full-green board. Zero GPU validation errors on every row. The native adapter stays
unrecorded and therefore unknown; the desktop report's `runtimeSha256` is the prebuilt binary.

**Where this leaves the PRD.** The hook handover is repaired and green on units, three browser
scenarios and both conformance lanes. Nothing else moved: Phase 2's quality scores and gates, Phase 3's
GPU/render p95 comparison and the PRD-269 ghosting cost all stay **open**, no new box is ticked by this
entry, and no full CI board, push or merge ran here.

### The depth-edge bypass measured out of the history decision (2026-10-06)

**The assumption, named and tested.** The previous entry asserted that every revealed pixel satisfies
the depth-edge bypass. That is replaced here by a paired **policy** ablation, which is what this
corpus can measure. One capture of the unmodified `scripts/verify-temporal-motion.ts` on the pre-fix
source carries both policies over the same 3,721 revealed interior pixels: `temporal` (bypass on) and
`strict-rejection` (the same arm with `edgeDepthDiff` at 1, so the term cannot be true). Bypass on
measures stale fractions [.28326, .17952, .086, .0817, .06047, .03924, .01639, .01451]; bypass off
measures [.01774, 0, 0, 0, 0, .01586, .00027, 0], while edge error (0.06054 against 0.06055),
instability (0.03136 against 0.03139) and excursion (0.000118 against 0.000115) barely move. That
supports the term as the cause of the aggregate residue and it buys nothing measurable here. It does
**not** count the decisions the GPU actually made per pixel, and no geometry is claimed for it. That
capture is preserved at `/tmp/opencode/pr398-preserved-062622/temporal-aa/motion` (19 scored arms,
adapter `nvidia/turing`); the bypass-on side was not re-measured here, because putting the term back
is a new policy change.

**The repair.** `historyValidity` is now `historyValid ∧ validUV ∧ ¬disocclusion`. One predicate, one
`Fn`, still called once per display pixel by `temporalRejectionCounter.ts`, so the published share
cannot diverge from the drawn decision; the shared `currentDepth` struct lost its now-unread
`farthestDepth` field with it. Generated template source, starter only. No new dependency, no preset,
no threshold, no harness. Installed three 0.185.1 `TAAUNode.js` keeps the same OR in its own
`hasValidHistory`; its remedy for its one-sided test is the thin-feature **lock** gate, a different
term, so the reference offers no narrower history rule to adopt than the one measured here.

**Red-green and actual exits.** `vitest run packages/create-threenative/__tests__/{scaffold,
temporal-resolve,temporal-aa}.spec.ts packages/core/__tests__/temporal-chain.spec.ts` → `4 files,
105 tests passed`, exit `0` (the scaffold pin follows the measured starter hash: `0d67385d…` for the
predicate change, `022310e487fa1c39e6b81fdcdbfb7cb13f5977e51fdf5c146c8c0696e9d9db19` after this
entry's comment correction; all 13 template hashes re-measured, every other one unchanged).
`pnpm typecheck` exit `0`, `biome check` on both touched files exit `0`, the helper is 195 lines after
Biome.

**Runtime, this commit.** The production script, unmodified: `sh scripts/xvfb.sh node --import tsx
scripts/verify-temporal-motion.ts` → exit `1`, all 31 arms captured with 18 PNGs each, no
`failure.json`, every arm's adapter `nvidia/turing`, scored by its own `measureSequence`
(`revealIndex` 8). `temporal` is **bit-identical to `strict-rejection`**: stale [.01774, 0, 0, 0, 0,
.01586, .00027, 0], edge 0.06055, instability 0.03139, moving-edge 0.02899, excursion 0.000115. The
exit `1` is the script's own gates, not a capture failure. The GPU rejection counter publishes a real
36-frame series for 22 arms (`visited` 230400, source age 0, every share finite) and an
`unavailable` object carrying its reason for the four fragment-overridden unchecked-history arms — no
fabricated zero. `quality-supersampled` captured this time (2560x1440 reference against the 640x360
display raster, 426x240 input), so the quality family is measured: `quality-temporal` stale [.0516,
.01908, .00457, .00349, .00376, .01774, .00215, .00457], edge 0.08239, instability 0.03573, against
`quality-spatial` [.03064, .03037, .06477, .03547, .03574, .06638, .0473, .03117].

**Browser P1 and native, this commit.** The three existing scenarios against
`examples/abyss-framework` (`scaled-lifecycle`, `scaled`, `scaled-unchecked-reset`; one managed server
on IPv4 loopback, custom Vulkan arguments, no recipe): 41 + 35 + 10 = **86 assertions passed, 0
failed**, each exit `0`, adapter `nvidia/turing`, `diagnostics: []` on all three. Native
`conformance/run-conformance.mjs --only-tests temporal-aa-scaled,
temporal-aa-scaled-unchecked-reset, temporal-aa-lifecycle, temporal-aa-quality` against the prebuilt
`build/tn-linux/mystral`: web `pass 4, fail 0, blocked 96` and desktop `pass 4, fail 0, blocked 96`,
both exiting `2` because the 96 unselected rows report **blocked**, never passed; each desktop row
measured `pixelMismatchRatio` 0 and `perceptualDeltaE` 0 against its `.06`/`9` tolerance with the
native process exiting `0`, and `provenance.commit` recorded `aeac68b2f` — this commit's only later
change is the comment above and that test pin, neither of which reaches the drawn frame. The native
lane publishes no WebGPU adapter, so none is claimed for it. Artifacts: `packages/runtime-native/
artifacts/conformance/pr398-native-aeac/` and `examples/abyss-framework/artifacts/
pr398-p1-aeac-*/`.

**What stays open, honestly.** `revealRecovery` is still false: the warm bound covers `afterReveal`
1–7 and afterReveal 5 measures .01586 against the pinned .01, while the ungated first reveal measures
.01774. That residual is not the bypass — the bypass is already off in the arm that measures it — it is
the pixels whose `closestDepth − previousDepth` never crosses `depthThreshold`, amplified at
afterReveal 5 by the luminance reweighting (the corpus's `resolve-cubic-strict-ordinary` arm, which
changes only the final blend, measures 0 there, and still measures .01559 when the reweighting stays).
The low-input quality family fails its own warm bound twice, afterReveal 1 at .01908 and afterReveal 5
at .01774, while `qualityBeatsSpatialStability` holds. Both Phase 2 boxes and the motion and quality
edge boxes stay **open**, no box is ticked by this entry, and no full CI board, push or merge ran
here.

### The missing cell of the blend/sampling ablation (2026-10-05)

**The cell that was missing.** The previous entry blamed the luminance reweighting from a single
paired arm: `resolve-cubic-strict-ordinary` changes only the blend and measures 0 at afterReveal 5,
while `resolve-cubic-strict` keeps the reweighting and measures .01559 there. That pair varies the
blend under **cubic** history sampling, so it cannot separate the blend from the sampling. The cell
that separates them is linear sampling plus the ordinary blend. The shipped default is linear sampling
plus the **luminance** reweighting — `temporalAA.ts` passes `"linear", "luminance"` — so that cell is
one change away from the default, not the default itself. This entry measured it.

**The change, one line, reverted.** `temporalAA.ts` passed `"luminance"` to
`createExperimentalTemporalResolve`; it passed `"ordinary"` for this run, with `"linear"` untouched so
the ablation varies the blend alone. No new helper, no new argument, no new dependency, and no
harness change: `temporalResolve.ts` already builds both arms from the installed TSL kernel, and the
installed `TAAUNode.js` (`three@0.185.1` patched) still shows the luminance `flickerReduction` it was
ported from, so this is a deliberate divergence from upstream, not a port defect.

**What the production script measured, on that change.** `sh scripts/xvfb.sh node --import tsx
scripts/verify-temporal-motion.ts` unmodified → exit `1`, **31 captured profiles** (22 motion + 9
quality), 16 frames each, no `failure.json`, every profile's adapter `nvidia/turing`. The earlier
entry's "32 arms" is a miscount, not a missing capture: the retained `f1b22c0be` capture
(`/tmp/opencode/pr398-motion-baseline-f1b22c0be/motion/summary.json`) holds the same 31 profile keys
and the same 19 scored rows, and the supersampled references (`supersampled`, `quality-supersampled`)
are captured but carry no scored row (`counters` empty). `qualityCorpus` is null only for the 22 motion arms, which have no quality corpus; `quality-supersampled` holds the measured object `{role: "reference", foliageCards: 6, alphaTest: 0.5, leafTextureSize: 16}`, so it is captured, not absent. `temporal` stale fractions
[.01774, 0, 0, 0, 0, **.01559**, .00027, .00027] against the pinned baseline
[.01774, 0, 0, 0, 0, .01586, .00027, 0] — the warm ghost at afterReveal 5 does not move. Edge error
0.05848 improves on 0.06055, instability 0.03193 worsens on 0.03139, and neither clears its gate, so
`edgeImprovement` stays false. `quality-temporal` stale [.0516, .01908, .00484, .00349, .00376,
**.01747**, .00188, .00457] against baseline [.0516, .01908, .00457, .00349, .00376, .01774, .00215,
.00457]: the low-input warm bounds still fail twice. The paired arms are unchanged by the change and
reproduce the previous numbers. Counters are unchanged: 27 arms publish a 36-frame share series
(`visited` 230400, source age 0, every fraction finite) and the 4 fragment-overridden
unchecked-history arms carry their `unavailable` reason; the decision is still the shared
`historyValidity` `Fn` sampled per display pixel, so no new engine API and no policy change reached the
render.

**The pixels that survive.** Measured with the harness's own `linearFrame` and its `revealIndex` 8
mask, against the `supersampled` reference: afterReveal 5 holds 62 stale pixels of 4225 revealed
interior pixels, all inside one strip — x ≈ 358–366, rows 135–199 — with residue 0.103–0.141, just
over the harness's 0.1 threshold. Their actual linear RGB is (0.078, 0.098, 0.153) against a target of
(0.264, 0.332, 0.470), and the pre-reveal value was the pure red marker (1, 0, 0). The residue is a
dark smear from the removed marker, not a red hue smear, so "the history keeps the old colour" does not
describe it: a narrow band is under-resolved on the frame the marker's silhouette used to cover.

**The causal result, and the decision.** With linear sampling held fixed, the ordinary blend does not
remove the ghost (.01559 where the pinned baseline measures .01586). With cubic sampling held, it does
(0). The blend's effect therefore **depends on the sampling**, and neither single-axis reading survives
this pair: it does not show that the blend is not the cause, and it does not show that sampling alone
is the cause. `resolve-cubic-strict-ordinary` is the only configuration in this corpus that clears the
warm bound, and it differs from the shipped default on **two** axes, sampling and blend, so the corpus
still holds no arm that isolates either axis against the default. That is a second, larger change than
this entry's budget allowed and it is not qualified as a default. The source is
therefore reverted to `f1b22c0be` and no product change ships: starter's tree pin stays
`022310e487fa1c39e6b81fdcdbfb7cb13f5977e51fdf5c146c8c0696e9d9db19`, all 13 template hashes are
unchanged, and `vitest run` over `scaffold`, `temporal-resolve`, `temporal-aa` and `temporal-chain`
is `4 files, 105 tests passed`, exit `0`.

**One honest harness consequence.** The run's exit `1` is not only the gates. `writeTemporalMotionSummary`
asserts `authoredLinearEquivalent` — the installed `temporal` arm must hash-match the `resolve-linear`
arm — and a deliberate default change makes that false by construction, so the assertion fired after
every arm was retained and `summary.json` was written with `pass: false`. No threshold, score, camera,
corpus or frame changed; a run whose default diverges from `resolve-linear` will always report this,
which is the check working, not a defect. Native and browser P1 lanes were not re-run here because no
runtime change ships.

**Both boxes stay open.** The ghost box needs the warm bound qualified at full and low quality with its
negative controls, native and counters; this entry qualifies the cause instead. The motion and quality
edge boxes stay open, and no box is ticked by this entry.
### The combined cubic + ordinary default, measured and reverted (2026-10-05)

**Two axes at once, reverted.** `temporalAA.ts` passed `"catmull-rom", "ordinary"` for one production run, so the shipped arm moved on sampling **and** blend at once; the depth-edge rejection arm and `temporalResolve.ts` were untouched, and only `temporal-resolve.spec.ts` changed, to compare the generated default arm with the provider's own default compilation. No threshold, corpus, pose, camera or frame changed.

**The run.** `sh scripts/xvfb.sh node --import tsx scripts/verify-temporal-motion.ts`; log `/tmp/opencode/pr398-motion-cubic-072259/motion-cubic.log`, summary `artifacts/temporal-aa/motion/summary.json`, 31 profiles. The log records **no exit code**: it ends in an uncaught `ERR_ASSERTION` from `writeTemporalMotionSummary` after every profile was retained, with `pass: false` because `authoredLinearEquivalent` is false once the shipped arm is not the linear one.

**Full resolution clears the warm bound.** `temporal` is bit-identical to `resolve-cubic-strict-ordinary`: edge .0555994, instability .0324191, stale [.01774, 0, 0, 0, .00027, 0, .00054, .00054] — afterReveal 1–7 clears the pinned .01. `edgeImprovement` stays false. That claim of bit-identity to the retained `f1b22c0be` capture is withdrawn: this run's `temporal` edge is .0555994 against the baseline's .0605459 and its instability .0324191 against .0313916, so the combined candidate moved both, and only `temporal` is byte-identical to `resolve-cubic-strict-ordinary`.

**Low input is where it fails.** `quality-temporal` stale [.0516, **.01908**, .00511, .00322, .0043, **.01747**, .00242, .00484] against the same .01 bound: afterReveal 1 and 5 fail, as under `linear` + `luminance` ([.0516, .01908, …, .01774, …]) and under `linear` + `ordinary`, so `qualityRevealRecovery` stays false. Edge .0806872 and instability .0364328 stay worse than `quality-spatial` (.0774488, .0505515), so `qualityEdgeImprovement` stays false.

**Decision and boxes.** It fails its own measurements at both resolutions, so nothing ships: the three dirty files are reverted to `563d64a8b`, the starter tree pin and all 13 template hashes are unchanged, and every capture is retained. Both Phase 2 ghost boxes, the motion and quality edge boxes and PRD-269's ghosting cost stay **open**; no box is ticked, and no browser or native lane was re-run because no runtime change ships.


### Current-frame reconstruction, measured and falsified (HEAD 8a20ae9ee + this commit)

**What the installed node does.** `three/examples/jsm/tsl/display/TAAUNode.js` (0.185.1, patched pin
`7036a173`) reconstructs the current frame as nine `load` taps on a 3×3 neighbourhood of the
jittered input lattice, each weighted `exp(-2.29 * d²)`, normalized by its own weight sum. The
generated kernel took one bilinear sample instead. No core Three patch was needed: `camera.view` is
public, so the jitter a gather must follow is read where upstream applied it.

**What was built and measured.** `createExperimentalTemporalResolve` gained
`reconstruction: "bilinear" | "blackman-harris"` with that nine-tap loop, `temporalAAFrame`
published the applied offset as `_jitterOffsetUniform`, `temporalAA.ts` installed the gather as its
default, and the fixture mapped a `resolve-reconstruction` arm. History sampling, blend,
`currentWeight`, clipping, rejection, velocity, counter, lifecycle, corpus, scoring and every
threshold stayed as they were, so this run isolates the current-frame reconstruction alone. The
whole-display cold-reset oracle was rebuilt as an independent nine-tap gather over the same immutable
input and the measured jitter, because a plain bilinear fetch can no longer be the expected cold
frame; the mutant that clears the reset flag still fails it.

**The run.** `sh scripts/xvfb.sh node --import tsx scripts/verify-temporal-motion.ts`, log
`/tmp/opencode/pr398-motion33.log`, recorded exit `1` in `/tmp/opencode/pr398-motion33.status`,
summary `artifacts/temporal-aa/motion/summary.json`. 33 profiles, 16 frames each, no `failure.json`,
`nvidia`/`turing` WebGPU in every arm: the retained 31, the explicit `resolve-reconstruction` arm, and
its matched `resolve-reconstruction-open` control the causal pairing requires. `authoredResolveEquivalent`
(the renamed equivalence oracle, now comparing the default against the arm that names the same
reconstruction) is **true**: the shipped default hashed equal to the explicit gather arm in all 16
frames, so the numbers below are that arm's, not a differently authored resolve.

**Full resolution.** `temporal` (= `resolve-reconstruction`): edge **.0641339** against the shipped
bilinear `.0605459` and the no-AA `.0502947`, so `edgeImprovement` is false and the gather is *worse*
than the sample it replaces. Instability `.0321929` still improves on `.0491286`. Reveal
[.00027, 0, .00027, 0, .00027, **.01586**, .00027, .00054]: afterReveal 5 holds the same warm ghost the
bilinear default draws, so `revealRecovery` is false.

**Low input.** `quality-temporal`: edge **.0812266** against `quality-reference` `.0493331`
(`qualityEdgeImprovement` false) and instability `.0347867` against `quality-spatial` `.0505515`, so
`qualityBeatsSpatialStability` passes at .687 of the spatial arm. Reveal [.04891, **.01801**, .00349,
.00269, .00322, **.01854**, .00215, .00376] fails the same .01 bound at afterReveal 1, 2 and 6, as
`linear` + `luminance` and `linear` + `ordinary` do. Causal red excess is 0 in all eight frames
against the matched open-history control, and the real GPU counter is published for both arms — 36
frames, 230 400 display pixels visited, finite fractions, source age 0 — so the ghost is a neutral
brightening, not a red history leak, exactly as the `luminance` and `ordinary` arms show. Checks:
11 true, 4 false (`edgeImprovement`, `revealRecovery`, `qualityEdgeImprovement`,
`qualityRevealRecovery`).

**Decision and boxes.** The installed node's own current-frame reconstruction is **not** the reveal
ghost's cause and not its fix: it costs full-resolution edge error, leaves the warm ghost at the same
.01586, and fails the low-input bound in three more places than the bilinear default. Nothing ships,
so all nine touched files are reverted to `8a20ae9ee`, `temporalAA.ts` keeps the bilinear default, the
starter tree pin and all 13 template hashes are unchanged, and every capture is retained (this run's
in `artifacts/temporal-aa/motion`, the previous 31-arm corpus in
`/tmp/opencode/pr398-motion-preserved-39f1d219`). No browser or native lane was re-run, because no
runtime change ships and the mode had no native proof. Every Phase 2 ghost box, the motion and quality
edge boxes and PRD-269's ghosting cost stay **open**; no box is ticked.

**Counts, corrected against the retained capture.** `fenceProfiles`, `rasters`, `counters`,
`qualityCorpus`, `velocityDiagnostics` and `provenance` all hold one key per captured arm — 31 in the
retained `f1b22c0be` corpus (22 motion plus 9 quality), 33 in this run — while scored rows are 19 and
20 respectively, and the `supersampled` / `quality-supersampled` references are captured without a
scored row. `qualityCorpus` is null only for the motion arms. Earlier "32 arms" and "512 frames"
figures were a miscount of a 31-arm corpus.


### Current develop and immutable owner source combined with CPU repairs (2026-10-05)

This isolated candidate normally merges develop checkpoint `9b3c4824c` into published PR398
`f04169f39` (local merge `844a67c27`), then integrates exact committed owner checkpoint
`a0830fec4`. No live owner fixture or motion-script patch was copied. Both temporal/velocity
and the newly landed animation/native lanes retain candidate-pinned checkouts, current-attempt
receipts and completion dependencies. Independent review and 100 routing/receipt tests passed.

The owner helper had moved renderer, colour and texture-size rejection outside the catch again.
The published repair is retained around the new frame helper: four rejected-input recovery cases
prove unchanged reports/frame counts on failure, both current-colour target reseeds at full
resolution, and subsequent accumulation. Fixed RTT colour now jitters on its measured raster;
automatic RTT colour uses its own public resolution scale and the upcoming drawing-buffer size.
Two composed-colour RTT cases cover both routes and a height-only display change. The scaled
conformance input expectation now follows pinned Three's `Math.floor`, preserving the authored
display resize's `Math.round`: the real pass at 800x600 changes input height to 266, not 267.

Explicit red/green: 33 passing / 7 failing CPU cases before repair, then 40/40 passing. The
combined focused set passes 303 tests across 14 files, including real WGSL compilation, template
source/instruction contracts, measured actual hashes for all 13 no-install generated scaffolds,
existing evidence/quality controls, and routing/receipts. Root TypeScript 7 checking and the final
40-case repair rerun also pass. The initial serial workspace check failed at the landed locomotion
example because the owned core declarations predated `AnimationPlayer.playWeighted`, present in
current source. After the approved serial rebuild, all eight public dependency packages pass their
normal build/publint commands: assets, playtest, engine MCP, Blender MCP, core, physics, UI and create.
At exact source commit `9e9ccc88f7c6afd468581e1cc95d90a56b4ae29d`, root TS7, serial workspace and
velocity-fixture typechecks all exit zero using CPUs 10 and 22 with one worker. Owned manifests and
individual logs are under `artifacts/pr398-cpu-contract/current-closure-build` and
`current-closure-typechecks`. Original thresholds and acceptance rows from the owner checkpoint are
unchanged. This is CPU evidence; no GPU/native capture ran here.

The matching lower-raster RTT cases do not qualify lower-raster exposure composition through
actual WorldEnvironment or the automatic scaler. Clean retained browser/native reports at
`aeac68b2f` remain historical source evidence, not execution of this combined candidate. Original
quality/ghosting, GPU/render cost, native combined-source qualification and automatic-scale
allocation/cost gates remain open. No new acceptance box is ticked, and publication remains held
until later owner commits and remote advancement are reconciled.


Independent merge review also found that an isolated `temporalRejectionCounter.ts` edit selected
no integration lane: the template subtree is excluded from the unknown-file fallback and the
new counter was absent from the temporal filter. The exact source path is now owned by the temporal
lane. The isolated routing regression fails before the selector repair; all 101 routing/receipt
contracts pass afterward. Candidate pins, job blocks, receipt policy and thresholds are unchanged.

Develop subsequently merged PR440 as `d3c009e4404abcc2041f58124693edb9c78d802b`. It is outside this
validated source checkpoint; its camera/material changes must survive later reconciliation and
scaffold fingerprints must be remeasured from that actual combined generator. The original owner
subsequently committed documentation-only `7e01edf58`; those later experimental claims were not
imported as qualification. The serial build slot is released; publication and new CI remain held.


### PR440 develop reconciliation and draft repair publication (2026-10-05)

Normal merge `6570965aae41d9c5db301dce5d9234e0fae4c6b6` combines reviewed local receipt
`828a54da5` and current develop `d3c009e4404abcc2041f58124693edb9c78d802b`. Its only conflict was
the scaffold fingerprint constant. All 13 fingerprints were remeasured through actual no-install
generator output; the original assertions and owner's temporal scaffold requirements are retained.
All 24 incoming camera/material template paths are byte-identical to PR440, and all six reviewed
temporal production/test repair files are byte-identical to source `9e9ccc88f`.

At exact merged source `6570965aa`, 306 affected CPU tests across 15 files pass, including PR440's
shared-graph/camera contracts, the 40 temporal repair cases and all 101 routing/receipt contracts.
Root TS7, serial workspace and velocity-fixture typechecks all exit zero on CPUs 10 and 22 with
one worker. The eight-package declaration closure previously rebuilt at `9e9ccc88f` is still current:
PR440 changes no public package implementation source. Exact manifests, measured fingerprints and
logs are retained under `artifacts/pr398-cpu-contract/developd3-integration`.

This resolves the subsequent develop conflict, preserving both features. Original quality/ghosting,
GPU/render cost, combined-source native and actual WorldEnvironment/automatic-scaler gates remain
open with their thresholds unchanged. No acceptance box is ticked. Draft repair publication is
authorized after fresh head/base/noncritical guards, clean independent merge review and normal
pre-push drift hooks; the PR must remain draft until original runtime acceptance is satisfied.


### Fresh original quality failure and bounded CPU repair — 2026-10-05

Published source `c5357e39d8ecd0c29802e3cb2af633a2af40dcaa` ran the unchanged 31-arm motion
verifier on hardware WebGPU (NVIDIA/Turing, Vulkan flags) from 17:16:06 to 17:19:49 UTC,
PID 1708586, 223 seconds, exit 1. All 31 captures completed with empty diagnostics; authored
linear equivalence and 11 checks passed. The four original edge/reveal checks still failed:
full-resolution edge 0.06054592 versus no-AA 0.05029465 (required <0.04777992), warm reveal
1.5856%; lower-input edge 0.08238862 versus no-AA 0.04933311 (required <0.04686646), warm reveal
1.9081% and 1.7737%, against the unchanged <=1% bound. All original arms, scenarios, pixels,
reports, hashes and terminal/lease receipts remain under
`artifacts/pr398-original-qualification/c5357e39d8ecd0c29802e3cb2af633a2af40dcaa/20261005T171606Z`.
This is quality evidence only; it does not qualify performance, native or the automatic scaler.

Actual pixel inspection finds all 59 full-resolution frame-34 failures on one dim fence column;
each pixel equals its matched never-occluded temporal control. The conservative stale gate stays
unchanged. Independent CPU controls isolate two narrower defects: luminance-reweighted blending
turns correctly registered 50% alternating linear coverage into mean 0.400194 instead of 0.5;
and replacing a raw central input sample with a bilinear display sample narrows the same nine-texel
variance bound from 0.804738 to 0.693517, incorrectly clipping legal history 0.75.

The generated provider now selects the existing ordinary blend, and its clipping moments count
nine raw input texels. The linear equivalence arm follows that production blend; weighted cubic
comparison arms remain available. Velocity, jitter, depth rejection, current weights, gamma,
reference/corpus, thresholds and negative controls are unchanged. Two real offline-WGSL contract
failures were recorded before repair (luminance weighting and eight point loads); the repaired
shader suite passes 5/5. The affected suite passes 307/307 across 15 files; root TS7, serial workspace
and velocity-fixture typechecks exit zero on CPUs 10 and 22, one worker. Actual no-install generation
changes only the starter fingerprint. Independent rendering/source review found no blocking issue.
The first expected fingerprint failure and new-test type annotation failure are retained alongside
the corrected green run. Portable controls, pixel diagnostics, reviews and validation receipts are
in the delegated task directory; no external images were uploaded.

These CPU repairs are a candidate for the next bounded hardware quality measurement, after PR388
releases the GPU. They do not prove the four original failed checks pass. All outstanding quality,
GPU/render cost, platform and automatic-resolution acceptance boxes remain open; PR398 stays draft
at `prd:25%`. Publication and the next GPU slot require parent coordination.
