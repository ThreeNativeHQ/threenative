# PRD-269 — motion vectors for skinned and instanced geometry, or the temporal filters lie

**Status:** PARTIAL — reopened for qualification on 2026-10-02 at `d7277838`; originally
filed 2026-08-29, measured at `7e5a9fe1`. Implementation landed in `3630847a`
(`squash: deliver PRD-269 motion history`), but the acceptance below is not fully qualified. Depends on
PRD-266; lands before
[PRD-268](PRD-268-light-that-comes-from-off-screen.md) is judged. Batch:
docs/PRDs/lighting.

**Goal: a character that moves does not smear.** This is the one thing `0beqz/realism-effects`
gives you that upstream's nodes do not — re-implemented in TSL rather than vendored, because that
library is GLSL against `WebGLRenderer` and cannot reach this stack's native targets.

**Complexity:** a velocity pass plus per-object previous-transform tracking for skinned and
instanced meshes = **MEDIUM**. The maths is well-trodden; the bookkeeping is where it goes wrong.

## The problem, measured at `7e5a9fe1`

### 1. Every effect worth having in this batch is temporal, and temporal means reprojection

SSGI, SSR and GTAO are all sample-starved per frame. Every practical use of them accumulates across
frames — `TRAANode`, `TemporalReprojectNode` and `RecurrentDenoiseNode` all exist in
`three/addons/tsl/display/` for that reason. Reprojection needs to know where each pixel *was* last
frame. Derived from depth and the camera matrices alone, that answer is only correct for geometry
that did not move relative to the world.

So on a static scene the filters are correct, and on the first animated character they are not: the
history sample comes from wherever that pixel used to be in world space, which is a different
surface. The artefact is a smear trailing the character and a halo of stale GI around it — worst on
exactly the content a game ships.

### 2. This is what `realism-effects` actually contributes, and it is why absorbing it fails

The batch evaluation rejects vendoring `0beqz/realism-effects` on hard grounds: it targets
`WebGLRenderer`, requires the pmndrs `postprocessing` package, and ships `.glsl` — none of which
executes on the `WebGPURenderer`-only native runtime. But its SSGI/TRAA quality does not come from
its GI maths alone; it comes from feeding those filters correct velocity for skinned and instanced
geometry, which is the part upstream's nodes assume you already have.

Take the idea, write it in TSL. That is the whole PRD.

### 3. Nothing in this repository produces velocity today

No velocity or motion-vector pass exists in `packages/core/src/`. `packages/core/src/skeleton.ts`
owns skinning and `packages/core/src/particles.ts` and the instanced paths own their own transforms;
none of them retains a previous-frame transform, and there is no buffer for a temporal node to read.

## What ships

`packages/core/src/render/velocity.ts`, exported from `@threenative/core`, and wired into the
PRD-266 chain as a provisioning stage rather than a user-facing effect:

- A velocity render target in the chain's canonical order, produced before any temporal stage
  consumes it, and skipped entirely when no temporal stage is requested — a game paying for a
  buffer nothing reads is the kill switch firing.
- **Previous-frame transform tracking** per drawn object: world matrix for rigid meshes,
  per-instance matrices for `InstancedMesh`/`BatchedMesh`, and bone matrices for skinned meshes.
  Double-buffered and updated once per frame at a defined point in the schedule, so a mid-frame
  transform write cannot produce a velocity that disagrees with the colour pass.
- A TSL velocity node computing the screen-space delta from current and previous clip positions,
  handed to `TemporalReprojectNode`/`TRAANode` through the chain rather than by the game.
- **Disocclusion reporting** — the fraction of pixels whose history was rejected this frame, under
  the chain's marker. A number that stays high means reprojection is not working, and today there is
  no way to know that other than by looking.

`BatchedMesh` deserves its own note: on WebGPU it is one render object issuing N `drawIndexed`
commands, so per-sub-draw previous transforms are what the velocity pass needs — the aggregate
object transform is not enough and will read as correct in every static test.

## Current implementation and bounded repair

The problem measurements above are historical, not a claim that the shipped engine has no
velocity implementation. Commit `3630847a` added `VelocityTracker`, RenderChain MRT provisioning,
the patched Three.js accessors, and CPU software-rasterization coverage. Reuse those mechanisms.
The engine-layer defect at `d7277838` is narrower: `SceneRenderProjection.reconcile()` and
`commit()` skip temporal bookkeeping when `renderer.projection: false`, so an authored
`BatchedMesh` has no previous-matrix texture even with temporal rendering active. Its patched
accessor consequently uses current sub-draw matrices as history. Projection opt-out must still
build no mirror and perform no eligibility scan; temporal-off must retain no history work.

### Phase 1 — qualify shipped motion history

- [x] Verify the existing per-object transform and MRT provisioning implementation. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/render-velocity.spec.ts`
- [x] Verify the shipped batched accessor and projection pipeline integration. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/batched-velocity.spec.ts packages/core/__tests__/render-projection-pipeline.spec.ts`

### Phase 2 — preserve temporal history through projection opt-out

- [x] Preserve explicit BatchedMesh sub-draw history across first and subsequent rendered frames with projection disabled. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/render-velocity.spec.ts`
- [x] Release/reset history on temporal toggles, removal and disposal without a projection scan or temporal-off traversal. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/render-velocity.spec.ts packages/core/__tests__/renderProjection.spec.ts`

- [x] Upload current and scheduled previous instance attributes in the same draw while retaining static upload elision. proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/instance-velocity-upload.spec.ts packages/core/__tests__/three-static-settled.spec.ts` (3 red before the repair; 5 uploader and 10 settled-static regressions green)

### Phase 3 — close original image-space acceptance

- [x] Add a playtest fixture for an authored moving BatchedMesh with projection disabled. proof: hosted run `36992451504` passed at `095eca85`; `pnpm exec tsx scripts/verify-velocity-history.ts` runs the actual WebGPU fixture and missing-history control
- [x] Qualify animated skinned geometry against a static wall with actual colour/velocity readbacks. proof: hosted `37006604512` at `68601527` passes the skinned arm; the current-as-previous bone control fails exactly motion/oracle assertions (stationary coverage excludes the conservative moving rectangle)
- [ ] Add the original animated-character ghosting playtest with a measured rejection-fraction assertion. proof: scenario drives the active temporal stage and fails if the velocity source is removed

The authored BatchedMesh fixture has actual browser GPU readback and screenshot proof. The
animated-character ghosting fixture remains implementation work; CPU software rasterization is not
a substitute for that image-space or native proof. The original acceptance and mutation descriptions are preserved
below and remain unqualified wherever no real lane has run.

## Blocked on

Actual relevant runtime screenshots must be attached to the PR before merge (owner requirement,
2026-10-02). The authored-batch browser pair below now satisfies the relevant screenshot-progress
requirement; full skinned/instanced, ghosting, frame-cost and native acceptance remain open.

Browser/native GPU execution requires a working WebGPU device or supported native host. This
cloud environment has no `/dev/dri`, Android device tooling or `/dev/kvm`; the batch's attempted
Xvfb launch failed with `EPERM`. Keep the PR draft until the original image-space and native
acceptance has real execution evidence. No GPU, frame-cost, ghosting or platform-parity result
is inferred from the CPU tests.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] **A moving skinned mesh produces non-zero velocity where it moved, and zero where it did not.** proof: hosted `37044051925` at `968a63b4` passes bone/root motion with exact MRT coverage (0.015625-pixel maximum error, zero exposed wall); current-world and current-bone history controls fail movement and both signed oracles at approximately 64 pixels. Native qualification remains separately open.
   A fixture animates one skinned mesh in front of a static wall; the velocity buffer is non-zero
   over the mesh's screen footprint and zero over the wall, within tolerance. *Mutation:* write the
   current world matrix into the previous-transform slot and the spec fails with a zero buffer over
   the mesh.

- [x] **Per-instance motion is per-instance.** proof: hosted `37006604512` at `68601527` passes browser `InstancedMesh` and `BatchedMesh` moving/static cases (0.015625-pixel maximum error); shared-transform controls fail exactly static/stationary bounds at 1.06640625. Native qualification remains separately open.
   With an `InstancedMesh` where one instance moves and the
   rest are still, velocity is non-zero only over the moving instance. *Mutation:* track one
   transform for the whole `InstancedMesh` and the spec fails by marking every instance as moving.
   The same case is asserted for `BatchedMesh` sub-draws.

- [ ] **Ghosting is measured, not judged by eye.** proof: PR #393 ghosting playtest with a pinned threshold and zero-velocity control (pending).
   A playtest drives a character across a
   GI-lit background and asserts the disocclusion-rejection fraction stays below a pinned threshold
   while the temporal stage remains active. *Mutation:* feed the temporal node a zero velocity
   buffer and the assertion fails on the rejection fraction — the failing number is pasted in the
   PRD's red before the fix lands.

- [ ] **No temporal stage requested, no velocity cost.** proof: `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/__tests__/render-velocity.spec.ts` plus PR #393 temporal-off/on frame-cost measurement (pending).
   With every temporal stage off, no velocity
   target is allocated and the `render` phase is unchanged within noise. *Mutation:* allocate it
   unconditionally and the allocation spec fails naming the target.

- [x] **Bookkeeping is frame-ordered, not incidental.** proof: hosted `37006604512` at `68601527` passes eight same-frame instance writes after history update, with 0.015625-pixel velocity error and <1.2e-13-pixel colour-centroid error; premature-commit mutation fails exactly motion/oracle bounds at 64 pixels.
   Moving an object after the velocity update
   point within the same frame produces a velocity consistent with the colour pass — the two agree
   or the frame is wrong. *Mutation:* update previous transforms at draw time instead of at the
   scheduled point and the ordering spec fails.

## Out of scope

Motion blur — it consumes the same buffer and is a look decision, so if a template wants it, it
ships in `templates/*/src/render/` on top of this. Velocity for the atmosphere and ocean compute
paths, which have their own lifetimes.

## Verification

First actual hosted capture: [run 36991957955](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/36991957955)
on `b1a8a9bef55b4dd1e05f7a4120d5d8122273fb81` produced the unchanged
[missing-history progress PNG](../../verification/prd269/without-history-progress.png) and
[artifact/adapter provenance](../../verification/prd269/progress-provenance.json). The actual
velocity MRT has zero moving pixels with bookkeeping removed; static and first-frame maxima
are also zero. The gate caught a fixture-count mistake: warmup waits do not call deterministic
steps, so the actual frame advanced 1 to 4, not 1 to 6. The scenario now requires `changed: true`
and at least four frames. The tracked variant was not reached in that run; it remains pending.
No device-loss warning was accepted. This is progress evidence, not completed acceptance.


2026-10-02 screenshot qualification in progress: the opt-in `velocity.html` fixture renders
an authored two-sub-draw `BatchedMesh` through the current source's `SceneRenderProjection`
with `projection: false`, then reads the actual velocity MRT. Its left panel is the colour
attachment and its right panel is absolute x/y velocity amplified 20 times. Each deterministic
step crosses a RAF boundary. The separate `without-history` run removes bookkeeping and must
fail only the moving-pixel bound, while static velocity and first-frame identity stay zero.
The `velocity` lane of `integration.yml` retains runtime PNGs, measured resources, source SHA and
adapter provenance even on failure. Local build and 263 focused tests pass; local capture
cannot start because this reset environment has no usable X display or Xvfb. Hosted image-space
results and screenshots are still pending, so no acceptance box is newly ticked here.


2026-10-02 repair: before the fix, `render-velocity.spec.ts` reports 4 failed / 12 passed:
missing `_previousMatricesTexture` in authored batch/frame-footprint tests, plus undefined
history in toggle and removal tests. Moving temporal enablement/update ahead of the opt-out
return and allowing its post-render commit makes the focused lane green: 117/117 tests across
`render-velocity`, `batched-velocity`, `render-projection-pipeline`, and `renderProjection`.
A broader direct core-suite run was interrupted before results while the targeted lane was rerun.
The tests assert first-frame identity, non-aliased texture history, next-frame advancement,
static/moving CPU footprints, toggle resets, removal/disposal, no eligibility scan, and no
steady-frame history traversal while temporal rendering is off. This verifies phases 1 and 2;
the CPU footprint fixture builds the patched Three.js nodes but is not GPU readback.

`pnpm lint` passes with 1,000 repository warnings. `pnpm typecheck` is killed with exit 137
before completing. `pnpm test` exits 2 before assertions because tsx cannot open its IPC socket
(`listen EPERM`). A direct core typecheck/build additionally needs the playtest package's missing
built declarations; its normal build reaches the same tsx IPC restriction. Running the same
validator with `node --import tsx` followed by the package's tsup build succeeds, after which
`tsc --noEmit -p packages/core/tsconfig.json` passes. After that dependency was available,
`pnpm --filter @threenative/core build` was rerun serially and passes ESM, DTS and publint
(exit 0). The root typecheck and full test suite remain unverified. `node packages/playtest/dist/runner/cli.js doctor --text` exits 2:
`TN_PLAYTEST_RUNNER_FAILED`, adb not found.

2026-10-02 qualification start: existing `render-velocity.spec.ts` passes 11/11 CPU tests.
`node --import tsx scripts/check-doc-links.ts` resolves 2,395 links; agent mirrors are in sync.
The prose test lane passes 178/180 tests; two `evidence-budget.spec.ts` subprocess cases are
blocked by tsx IPC `listen EPERM` in this environment. No code was changed for those failures.

`pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`; the ghosting playtest with the before/after rejection
fraction pasted; `pnpm visuals:ab` on a template with an animated character. Native parity follows
PRD-270. `pnpm tsx scripts/count-loc.ts` runs against this one specifically — a velocity pass a
game could write portably in fewer lines than the framework's version is the kill switch, and the
defence is the per-instance and per-bone bookkeeping, counted across every call site rather than
one.


2026-10-02 actual authored-batch GPU proof at `095eca855ea9f27260a761a72cba0d4d423087ec`:

- [Hosted run 36992451504](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/36992451504) passed. Artifact `11219953627` SHA-256 `32d6cd4e60b6e244c397178b656126f073c47e1691870932ff80996ed7949083` verified after download. [Runtime provenance](../../verification/prd269/runtime-36992451504.json) records exact source, adapter, metrics and diagnostics.
- Actual 960 × 540 Google SwiftShader WebGPU screenshots: [tracked history](../../verification/prd269/tracked-36992451504.png), [missing-history control](../../verification/prd269/without-history-36992451504.png). Both were independently visually inspected: matching lit spheres occupy the beauty half; only tracked moving sub-draws produce the red velocity silhouette. Images are unchanged runtime PNG bytes.
- Four actual RAF-separated rendered frames per arm. Both start with zero velocity; tracked final moving footprint has 25,676 nonzero pixels and maximum 0.0999755859375, static footprint maximum 0. The missing-history control remains zero and fails exactly `resource.motion.movingPixels`; positive diagnostics are empty, with no device-loss warning in either arm. The control disables actual history production rather than rewriting observations.
- This closes only the bounded authored-BatchedMesh fixture item. InstancedMesh/skinned GPU cases, active temporal ghosting/rejection measurements, frame-cost/native proof and full acceptance remain open. Software-adapter correctness is not hardware performance proof; PR remains draft.

## Instance attribute upload repair (2026-10-02)

PR #398's actual WebGPU probe at `dd541a46` ([run 36997077219](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/36997077219)) found a shipped defect independent of its new reconstruction helper: the default previous-instance attribute kept its initial GPU bytes, and `DynamicDrawUsage` exposed a one-frame upload delay. At frame 24 the instance velocity read `(0.0006814, 0.0727539)` versus expected `(-0.0005882, -0.0035371)`, a 13.74-pixel error. The dynamic arm's residual equals two frames of displacement within 0.002 pixel after removing the separately diagnosed helper jitter error. That helper repair remains in PR #398.

The real Three accessor plus `Attributes` uploader, invoked through `Renderer._renderObjectDirect`, reproduced three failures: current static instance bytes lagged, dynamic previous bytes lagged, and temporal-off current writes lagged too. The engine patch now restores upstream before-node/geometry ordering, synchronizes current matrix/color versions in the before-frame event, and writes scheduled previous matrices with explicit dirty signals before geometry upload. Unscheduled Three callers retain their draw-time history snapshot. No history is constructed without previous data, and unchanged temporal-off draws perform zero additional attribute uploads.

The ordering inversion came from `a602467d` / PR #375's settled-static repair. Its recorded requirement is that every structural draw step runs while unchanged object updates, uniforms and attribute scans are elided. Those steps and per-manager decisions remain intact; the existing static and late-bind-group tests are retained. The maintained browser fixture now also exercises default and dynamic `InstancedMesh` with signed current-minus-previous velocity, unequal steps, reversals, a stop and a restart. Its maximum-error threshold is 0.05 pixel including half-float quantization. Hosted evidence for this extension is pending; the earlier authored-batch screenshots above remain valid for their cited source.

Local verification for the instance-upload extension: **190/190** focused motion, settled-static, shader, shadow, patch-upgrade and interleaved-disposal tests passed. Root `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`, strict fixture types, the fixture Vite build, core ESM/DTS/publint build, and native-smoke single-file bundle plus 4/4 tests passed. This is native bundle compatibility, not native rendering proof. Quality JSON and the 72 MiB verification evidence budget pass; 2,400 documentation links checked. Independent review and the new hosted velocity arms are pending.

Packaging/scaffolding follow-up: 73/74 initially passed; the byte-stability pin failed because every generated project embeds the changed Three patch. For all 13 templates, restoring only the generated patch reproduces the exact prior hash. Measured pins updated; **74/74** now pass, including clean-consumer patch application/idempotency. Root lint passes with 1,000 existing warnings. No runtime acceptance was inferred from these packaging checks.

Independent review found and reproduced a consumer-upgrade refusal: the prior `dcbc5131` patch's changed hunks matched neither stock nor the candidate. The exact prior files (Git blobs from develop `416ffd7c`) now have a four-file migration with full old/output blob checks. Every file is still preflighted before any writes; unknown edits refuse. The real upgrade regressions were **2 failed / 5 passed** before this repair and now pass for LF and CRLF, idempotence, and one-byte tamper refusal without partial writes. Fresh-stock and packed-consumer coverage remains green (**15/15** upgrade/packaging tests). This migration does not accept arbitrary historical or custom patches.

Final local core lane after the upgrade repair: **2,221 passed, 2 skipped, 175 files** (`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1 packages/core`, 114.77 s). Independent review cleared the renderer repair and verified actual packed prior-version LF/CRLF upgrades, byte equality, idempotence and tamper refusal; its final uploader/static sanity lane passed 30/30. The hosted MRT extension remains the next proof gate; original acceptance stays open pending actual execution.

## Repaired instance velocity: actual WebGPU proof

[Run 37003076606](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/37003076606) passed at source `47e188e41601a64decb4fe0f580037546d63b543`. Artifact `11224711152` has verified ZIP SHA-256 `bca60e256985287d5eeeda1b7942d17ef5a3c5b5a056f35f7093520a7a1ae667`. On Google SwiftShader WebGPU, the authored `BatchedMesh`, default `InstancedMesh` and `DynamicDrawUsage` arms each rendered nine RAF-separated frames and matched the signed current-minus-previous oracle within **0.015625 pixel**, below the fixed **0.05-pixel** bound. First-frame, static-footprint and stopped-frame velocity were exactly **0**; the moving footprint contained **25,676** nonzero pixels. Positive diagnostics were empty. The actual missing-history batch control measured **64 pixels** of error and failed exactly the movement and oracle assertions.

All four runtime PNGs were visually inspected. The three positive PNGs are byte-identical, so one unchanged image is retained for them: [repaired instance velocity](../../verification/prd269/instanced-37003076606.png), [missing-history control](../../verification/prd269/without-history-37003076606.png), and [full adapter/readback/provenance](../../verification/prd269/velocity-37003076606.json). Left halves are actual colour; right halves visualize actual velocity. These captures qualify the explicit browser cases, not native rendering, skinned deformation, active temporal rejection or hardware cost. The original acceptance checkboxes remain open where their complete proof is still pending.

## Remaining footprint and ordering fixtures (in progress)

The maintained browser fixture now adds a real bone-animated `SkinnedMesh` in front of a static wall; its mutation writes the current bone pose into scheduled history. Both batched and instanced aggregate-history controls broadcast one moving-instance previous matrix to both slots, so static geometry must be falsely marked as moving. A late-write arm schedules history before writing the current instance transform; its mutation prematurely commits that new transform before the draw. These cases compare actual colour-silhouette position and signed velocity against the same current pose, and inspect all static pixels outside the moving geometry bounds. The fixed 0.05-pixel velocity bound remains; the colour centroid bound is 0.5 pixel. No readback numbers are replaced by controls. New readback guard tests went 4 failed / 3 passed to 7/7 passed; hosted execution is pending before any new acceptance tick.


## Skinned, per-instance and frame-order GPU qualification (2026-10-02)

[Hosted run 37006604512](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/37006604512) passed all ten expected outcomes at source `68601527451c6530762a5bdcd1c52e562c6e33fe`, tree `f5ae8b1d01300313e867ebb02ec641388312a312`. Artifact `11225942712` ZIP SHA-256 `415fddc91e60806f90b63dd7b82e31ece9ed554324a3d9bf7971ba6fe0f1b177` is verified. [Full per-frame observations, assertions and adapter provenance](../../verification/prd269/velocity-37006604512.json) retain all ten arms. Unchanged PNGs were visually inspected and byte-identical captures deduplicated.

- Actual Google SwiftShader WebGPU, 960 × 540, nine RAF-separated frames per arm. Batched, static/dynamic instance, skinned and late-write positives all have maximum signed velocity error 0.015625 pixel, colour-centroid error below 1.2e-13 pixel, and zero static, stationary-region, first-frame and stopped-frame velocity. Positive diagnostics are empty; no device-loss diagnostic is accepted.
- [Skinned sphere](../../verification/prd269/skinned-37006604512.png) deforms through its bound bone. Its [current-as-previous control](../../verification/prd269/skinned-current-history-37006604512.png) preserves colour while removing all moving velocity, failing exactly movement and oracle bounds (64-pixel maximum error). The stationary check excludes a conservative moving rectangle, so it does not yet qualify every exposed wall pixel or the original world-transform mutation.
- Both shared-transform controls produce the same [incorrect static-instance velocity](../../verification/prd269/aggregate-batch-37006604512.png): static/stationary maximum 1.06640625, failing exactly those two assertions. Ordinary per-instance arms retain zero static velocity. This qualifies the original per-instance browser criterion.
- Eight actual instance writes after the history-update point produce colour and velocity consistent with the latest pose. Prematurely committing the current pose before drawing preserves colour but removes motion (64-pixel error), failing exactly movement and oracle bounds. This qualifies the specified same-frame ordering case.
- Fresh local tests pass 28/28; independent fixture review passed 35 tests, strict types/Biome and its own bound-skinned CPU oracle. Earlier broader local fixture/CI checks passed 169/169. Hosted motion tests, strict types and the actual capture gate all pass.
- Ghosting/rejection, temporal-off frame cost, native rendering and full skinned acceptance remain open. PR #398 separately observed a one-frame instance Y-velocity loss after context/material recompile despite correct CPU history and unchanged shader assignments; this lifecycle case remains under investigation and is not covered by the ordinary-frame acceptance above.
- An unrelated inherited tone workflow failed at this head because `pnpm test:tone` is absent from the older branch base, before rendering or artifact capture. It is not a failed velocity run; synchronize merged develop changes before final full-CI qualification.


## Attribute-wrapper rebuild repair (in progress, 2026-10-02)

PR #398's observed context recompile is a separate shipped uploader defect. Actual GPU readback in [run 37008638293](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/37008638293), source `aabfa027`, shows fresh current-matrix wrappers reusing the same interleaved GPU buffer at frame 23. Four `createAttribute` calls see an existing buffer; CPU current Y is -0.6999545693/version 23, but GPU current Y remains -0.6924691796 from frame 22, equal to the correctly uploaded previous Y. Frame 24's ordinary update catches up. The diagnostic does not alter the 208 captured PNGs.

The real `Attributes` manager plus real `WebGPUAttributeUtils` reproduces two failures with a byte-copy GPU queue: a fresh wrapper skips dirty bytes, including explicit update ranges. The candidate records the shared buffer's uploaded version and render-call ID, then updates an existing dirty buffer before the manager marks its new wrapper current. DynamicDrawUsage without a version bump reproduced an additional failure; rebuilt dynamic columns now refresh once per render call without multiplying uploads. Unchanged wrappers upload nothing; four rebuilt columns share one update; ordinary writes and disposal/recreation retain their behavior. The original candidate passed 30/30 uploader/static/disposal/migration checks and 18/18 packaging/upgrade checks. The added dynamic regression is one red case; final combined uploader/static/disposal/packaging/migration coverage passes 39/39.

Both actual predecessor states are recognized by full blob hashes: develop patch `dcbc5131` and published PR393 patch `455ed1dd`. Their LF/CRLF upgrades are exact and idempotent. Partially patched migration files with an unknown full hash now fail before any file is written; one-byte custom edits from both predecessors reproduce that refusal. Other append-only patch files retain the existing upgrade behavior. All thirteen generated scaffold hashes return to their previous published values when only the embedded patch is restored.

The maintained actual MRT fixture now has an instance context-recompile arm with a checked rebuild count and the same 0.05-pixel oracle. Independent review and hosted candidate execution remain pending. No new acceptance criterion is ticked for this candidate.

Final candidate validation before review: full core **2,229 passed, 2 skipped, 175 files**; scaffold/capture **73/73**; core ESM/DTS/publint; native-smoke single import-free bundle plus **4/4** tests; root and strict fixture TypeScript; actual fixture Vite build; root lint (1,004 existing warnings); quality JSON; documentation links and fixed evidence budget all pass. Native-smoke remains bundle proof only. The initial fixture build invocation used the repository root and could not resolve its entry; rerunning from the example directory, as the maintained verifier does, passes. The two provenance JSON files were formatted without changing any parsed value or PNG byte.


### Independent review: mixed attribute wrappers

Review of the unpublished `2ba7498c` candidate found a partial-range regression through the real `Geometries` → `Attributes` → `WebGPUAttributeUtils` path. A fresh wrapper uploaded range 13 and cleared it; an older wrapper then requested another update from its stale local version, causing a full upload of unmarked element 12. The published `455ed1dd` path wrote once and retained GPU values `[0, 2]`; the candidate wrote twice and produced `[99, 2]`.

The shared version/render-call guard now also covers ordinary updates, so a wrapper cannot re-upload an already consumed range. Both wrapper orders are tested with static/dynamic usage, with and without a version bump; a genuinely newer static version in the same render call still uploads. The three fresh-first regressions were red, then all 15 shared-buffer/disposal cases passed. The reviewer's original probe now reports one upload and `[0, 2]` for both published and revised code.

Revised source patch `d000f4c4449145e81da0aba078c1d9e7becb205dfa440742f62eb6d0e97765e0` and both supported predecessor migrations pass the 48-test uploader/static/disposal/packaging/upgrade lane. Source and both shipped WebGPU method bodies agree after normalizing only the existing bundled descriptor identifier; installed files match the generated patched bytes exactly. All thirteen scaffold hashes restore to the published baseline when only the embedded patch is restored. Full core: **2,238 passed, 2 skipped, 175 files**. Scaffold/capture: **73/73**. Core ESM/DTS/publint, native-smoke single import-free bundle plus **4/4**, fixture build, root lint (1,004 warnings) and quality JSON pass. Re-review and actual candidate GPU execution remain pending; no acceptance box changes.

### Independent review: compute uploads

Re-review of unpublished patch `d000f4c4` found that its upload guard used only `info.render.calls`. Real `Bindings.updateForCompute` also consumes this uploader, but compute-only calls advance `info.calls` and `info.compute.calls` while render calls remain zero. Dynamic storage bytes therefore stayed at their initial value without a version bump. This is a candidate regression, not a claim that published `455ed1dd` has the compute defect.

The guard now uses the pinned renderer's global `info.calls`, which advances before both render and compute and is preserved by ordinary frame-metric resets. Three new regressions through real `Bindings`, `Attributes`, `Geometries` and `WebGPUAttributeUtils` were red on the prior candidate, then pass: compute-only dynamic storage and alternating compute/render partial-range uploads for storage and interleaved attributes. Repeated consumers in one call still write once; unmarked bytes remain unchanged. The existing static, dynamic, mixed-wrapper order and disposal checks pass with them (**18/18**). Source patch SHA-256 is `daef254ca250dffe6977b8c926682a943688236f9f95ddcafe231b41bb0e203c`; upgrade patch SHA-256 is `64dfa910b3f066f036759babc1a9917eaed295c1607149b1ccfcab5e3c4cc47d`.

The focused uploader/static/packaging/migration lane passes **46/46**, including exact LF/CRLF upgrades from both published predecessors, idempotence and tamper refusal before any write. Source and bundled method bodies agree, installed bytes match, and all thirteen measured scaffold hashes restore to the published baseline when only the embedded patch is restored. Independent re-review and actual candidate GPU execution remain pending; no acceptance box changes.

Final local validation of this revision: full core **2,241 passed, 2 skipped, 175 files** (124.09 s); scaffold/capture **73/73**; core ESM/DTS/publint; native-smoke single import-free bundle plus **4/4**; root and strict fixture TypeScript; root lint (1,004 warnings); quality JSON; 2,410 documentation links and the fixed evidence budget all pass. The original mixed-wrapper reviewer probe still reports one upload and `[0, 2]` for both published `455ed1dd` and revised code. Native-smoke remains bundle compatibility proof, not native rendering proof.

### Recompile GPU qualification (2026-10-02)

After independent re-review, source `ac7e78978854beea2c7db1026b26da5ea2f71716` published exact reviewed tree `4bda5b10b1c7017ff9d2c6ae4354646b3eb6b373`. [Velocity run 37016640068](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/37016640068) passes all eleven expected outcomes; [tone run 37016640190](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/37016640190) also passes. Velocity artifact `11230098453`, 197,296 bytes, has verified ZIP SHA-256 `b130ad7a4a3b313d65d5c29789effdea28bf61eac210a576a9f6d79e779d66f1`. [Exact readbacks, diagnostics, adapter and image provenance](../../verification/prd269/velocity-37016640068.json) retain the observations.

The new instance arm performs one actual context rebuild. All nine RAF-separated signed samples exactly equal the ordinary instance arm: maximum error 0.015625 pixel, maximum colour-centroid error below 1.2e-13 pixel, and zero static/stationary/first-frame/stopped-frame velocity. Positive diagnostics are empty. The previous ten arms retain exact motion values and PNG bytes, and each negative still fails only its specified assertions. All eleven PNGs pass the maintained blank guard. Actual recompile/control PNGs were visually inspected; their unchanged bytes already exist as [instance velocity](../../verification/prd269/instanced-37003076606.png) and [missing history](../../verification/prd269/without-history-37003076606.png), so provenance maps to those files without duplicate image storage.

This qualifies the maintained authored-instance recompile case. PR #398 still needs its separate combined temporal-helper rerun; exact exposed-wall/skinned mutation, GI ghosting/rejection, temporal-off frame cost and native rendering remain open. No original acceptance box changes, and the PR remains draft at 75% (7/8 phase boxes, 2/5 acceptance).

### Exact skinned footprint qualification (in progress)

The initial fixture candidate replaced the conservative rectangle with a blue-colour mask. Three reader tests were red, then ten capture/diagnostic tests passed, including a contaminated wall pixel inside the old rectangle and a wrong edge velocity that a centre-only sample misses. Independent review then found that dark shaded sphere pixels fall below this classifier's thresholds; the correction below supersedes that incomplete mask. Hosted qualification remains pending.

A CPU probe using the actual attached `SkinnedMesh` and scheduled tracker matrices predicts a separate world-motion defect: translating the mesh root by -0.25 yields -0.50 under the pinned previous-position multiplication order. `Skinning.js` uses the current `bindMatrixInverse` for previous bones, while `VelocityNode` also uses the previous world matrix. Replacing only the scheduled previous world matrix with current produces -0.25 instead of the required zero control. The maintained fixture adds these two explicitly labeled diagnostic arms before any engine repair; the ordinary world-motion arm is expected to fail both signed oracles. This is a CPU prediction awaiting actual GPU evidence, not a closed acceptance criterion. The reviewed uploader patch is unchanged.

Fixture-only local validation: **41/41** capture, motion, instance-upload and settled-static tests; root and strict fixture TypeScript; fixture Vite build; scoped Biome and quality JSON pass. Actual GPU execution and independent fixture review remain pending.

### Review correction: deterministic raster coverage

The stored skinned screenshot's moving pixel (344, 325) is RGB (14, 46, 81), while its matching velocity pixel is non-zero. Its linear blue value is below the rejected 0.09 cutoff. An independent lighting probe at normal (0, -0.9, 0.43589) likewise gives linear RGB (0.00366, 0.02233, 0.06924). The added captured-dark-pixel regression fails the old classifier.

The revised fixture writes a binary coverage attachment in the same depth-tested MRT draw as colour and velocity. A real object-update uniform selects the authored moving object, and fragment X selects its right-side subdraw; every current sphere vertex stays strictly on its authored side across all nine poses, including both bone and root motion. The compiled WGSL uses only that object identity and fragment coordinate. It has no shading, colour texture, velocity or previous-pose input. This coverage is supplementary to actual colour and signed velocity, not replacement image evidence.

Every covered pixel retains the fixed 0.05-pixel signed oracle; every complementary pixel retains the 1e-5 stationary bound. The reader rejects missing, non-finite and non-binary coverage, and reports the covered dark pixels the old classifier would omit. The playtest requires these dark pixels to exist in every frame. The actual stored PNG regression, malformed-ID checks, real Three shader/object-update test and full vertex-side test pass **14/14**. Actual GPU qualification remains pending; the separate attached-skinned world-motion diagnostic remains an expected failure, and no acceptance box is ticked.

Revised local fixture gate: **186/186** capture, coverage, motion, instance-upload, settled-static and CI-structure/selection tests; root and strict fixture TypeScript; fixture Vite build; scoped Biome; quality JSON; and 2,413 documentation links pass. The production patch remains exactly `daef254ca250dffe6977b8c926682a943688236f9f95ddcafe231b41bb0e203c`. Independent re-review precedes hosted publication.

### Actual exact-coverage red and bind-inverse repair (2026-10-02)

[Hosted WebGPU run 37024724225](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/37024724225) at `085c977b86928a4fc4b0729188eb6e4a33664f7f` confirms all thirteen expected diagnostic/control outcomes. Artifact `11234397468` is 239,270 bytes with verified ZIP SHA-256 `6828142e479f1ccc987c59afb5c81776d0ff266e358f2744c4a8ad5d2c69e6df`. [Exact motion and immutable image-byte provenance](../../verification/prd269/velocity-37024724225.json) preserves the actual observations without duplicating unchanged PNGs.

The exact binary coverage contains at least 25,676 moving pixels and 926 dark pixels per frame. Every positive moving pixel agrees within 0.015625 pixel, and every complementary pixel, including exposed wall at the silhouette, is exactly zero. The attached-skinned root-motion diagnostic confirms the predicted engine bug: velocity is doubled, with **63.96875-pixel** signed and full-footprint error. Replacing previous world with current incorrectly makes this diagnostic pass, instead of producing the required zero-motion control. The actual skinned colour/velocity and missing-history images were visually inspected; their bytes match the earlier stored images.

The repair schedules a separate previous bind inverse per mesh at the same pre/post-render boundary as world and bone history. Three's previous skinning position consumes that matrix; current colour/normal skinning remains unchanged. Sharing a skeleton does not share the mesh's inverse. The compiled shader regression was red at 0.202035-unit previous-position error under translation/rotation/scale and 0.25-unit error in the world-history mutation, with a missing late-write snapshot. These three cases now pass; detached mode, render/compute compilation, recompilation, shared-skeleton meshes and cleanup are also covered. Exact full-blob migrations retain all three published predecessor states and reject tampered input before writing any file.

Actual GPU qualification of the repair remains pending. The original skinned acceptance stays unticked until the ordinary world-motion arm passes and the original current-world-history mutation fails with zero motion. GI ghosting/rejection, temporal-off frame cost and native rendering remain open; the PR remains draft at 75%.

Candidate validation on the original `085c977b` base: full core **2,253 passed, 2 skipped, 177 files** using the repository-pinned pnpm; skin/history/migration **20/20**, uploader/packaging/CI slice **186/186**, and scaffold **66/66**. All thirteen scaffold trees restore to their exact previous values when only the embedded Three patch is restored. Root and strict fixture TypeScript, core/public playtest ESM/DTS/publint, the actual fixture build, native-smoke single import-free bundle plus **4/4**, root lint (1,004 existing warnings), quality output, docs and evidence budget pass. Native-smoke is bundle compatibility only. The full root test launcher and two evidence-budget CLI tests cannot create tsx IPC sockets in this executor; the unchanged budget validator runs successfully through `node --import tsx`.

Publication preflight found the concurrent normal develop merge `9ab3a41022f86b74f76170f6122144be516d343a`. Its new fluid importer retained a removed `dcbc5131` patch reference, reproducing `ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_MISSING_DEPENDENCY` in a frozen install. The official pnpm lockfile repair preserves the entire importer and all dependency versions while resolving the same reviewed `63aa4b9b` patch everywhere. The merged frozen install, **48/48** fluid/motion/skin/migration tests, strict fixture TypeScript/build, 2,462 relative documentation links and the fixed evidence budget pass. The reviewed repair bytes and all thirteen scaffold hashes are unchanged. Full merged-source aggregate checks remain separate from those earlier full-core results; actual candidate GPU proof is still required.

### Bound-skinned GPU acceptance qualified (2026-10-02)

[Actual WebGPU run 37044051925](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/37044051925), exact source `968a63b46654670e222eaa884f006d18a8b08fa4` and tree `d30fd9d020c2005a3e99177bf69584fa53a7d73d`, passes all thirteen expected outcomes. [Tone run 37044051848](https://github.com/ThreeNativeHQ/threenative/actions/runs/37044051848) also passes. Artifact `11243013534` is 238,086 bytes; independently downloaded ZIP SHA-256 is `f1fe51b3488ba8e99dd59f2281086e28df9d2288d63af6e30321e70d74f6a6c8`. [Exact measurements and image-byte provenance](../../verification/prd269/velocity-37044051925.json) records the full nine-frame sequences.

Skinned root motion now agrees with the analytic signed displacement at every covered pixel: **0.015625-pixel** maximum error, down from **63.96875 pixels** in the actual red. The exact complementary footprint, including every exposed wall pixel, is zero. Bone motion remains within the same bound. Both originals are present: current bone history gives zero movement; current world history leaves only 1.79e-7 NDC numerical noise, below the 1e-5 zero bound. Each control fails exactly movement plus both fixed signed oracles (approximately 64-pixel error). Positive diagnostics are empty; no device-loss downgrade is accepted. Static, first and stopped-frame velocities remain zero.

All thirteen actual PNGs pass the maintained blank guard. The root-motion positive and original world-history control were visually inspected: their exact bytes match the existing [skinned velocity image](../../verification/prd269/skinned-37006604512.png) and [zero-history image](../../verification/prd269/skinned-current-history-37006604512.png), respectively. They are stored once and mapped by hash in the new provenance. The unchanged visualization clips large motion, so the correction is established by signed GPU readbacks rather than a claim of visible screenshot differences.

Fresh final merged-source core: **2,265 passed, 2 skipped, 178 files**; core ESM/DTS/publint and root TypeScript pass. This closes the browser skinned coverage/world-mutation criterion, bringing acceptance to **3/5** with **7/8 phase boxes**, still draft **75%**. Ghosting/rejection, temporal-off frame cost, native rendering and the full repository CI board remain unqualified.

### Temporal-off CPU protocol pinned before runtime capture

The new opt-in cost fixture holds one renderer, scene, camera and colour pass fixed. The real `RenderChain` requests no stages and the real `SceneRenderProjection` is disabled. Two identical baseline arms omit the temporal bookkeeping entry points; the temporal-off arm calls the ordinary reconcile/render/commit path. Each triplet rotates its first arm and reverses every second group, covering all six orders. Thirty warmup triplets precede measured work. Each arm retains exactly 150 actual `FrameBudget` render-phase samples; the runner's two preliminary ticks are naturally replaced by the fixed-size window. The complete retained per-frame series, median and 95th percentile are recorded. A real one-pixel GPU readback drains each draw outside the timed CPU phase, and every draw has its own RAF boundary. No timing sample is dropped.

The fixed equivalence allowance at each of p50 and p95 is the larger of two measured clock ticks or twice the difference between the two control arms. The clock must resolve at least 0.1 ms. Excessive control noise fails separately: the allowance cannot exceed the larger of 0.2 ms or 25% of the baseline cost. Overhead above that allowance fails; FrameBudget records samples and summaries at 0.01 ms, and the measured browser clock can be coarser. Excess arithmetic alone is rounded to 0.000001 ms to suppress floating-point subtraction residue; this grants no extra physical timing precision. These thresholds are fixed before any runtime result and will not be relaxed to pass a capture.

The fixture also requires zero velocity targets, zero retained object history and zero active/provisioned temporal stages on every observed frame. It uses actual frame-recorder values and rendered pixels, not an estimated loop cost or a mocked renderer. The existing unconditional-allocation regression remains intact. The numerical evaluator rejects added median/tail cost, inflated control noise, missing samples and invalid observations. Runtime qualification is pending. SwiftShader measurements will qualify only this software-renderer CPU submission path; native rendering, hardware GPU cost and hardware frame-rate claims remain open.


Before closing the off-cost criterion, the same fixture also runs after three real motion-blur activation/disposal cycles. Inspection of the actual pinned `PassNode` and `RenderChain` reproduces a lifetime gap: disposal restores `MRT=null` but retains the lazily created `velocity` entry in `renderTarget.textures`. The new after-consumer arm is explicitly diagnostic and must fail only its zero-velocity-target assertion; it does not qualify the acceptance criterion. It records that the consumer actually allocated the attachment before turning off, while preserving the same timing/resource bounds as the fresh-off arm. Actual GPU reproduction and ownership-safe cleanup remain pending; the production motion patch is unchanged.


Independent fixture review passed 17 evaluator/capture tests and verified that all six retained arm orders occur exactly 25 times each. It confirmed that the after-consumer baselines also retain the attachment: their relative timing cannot price that shared cost, so only the explicit zero-target failure establishes this lifetime diagnostic. The attachment criterion remains open until ownership-safe cleanup and a fresh runtime pass. Before publication, the complete local fixture/recorder/CI slice passes **199/199**, root and strict fixture TypeScript and the fixture build pass, scoped Biome is clean, and 2,465 documentation links pass. No GPU cost result is claimed yet.


### Temporal-toggle lifecycle repair and develop merge (2026-10-04)

Published repair `004e4b8afdbd188bc275722bd6d6187943d4c4d4` restores the original MRT,
invalidates the old physical attachment set before detaching the chain-owned velocity texture,
and reattaches the cached texture on reactivation. Caller-owned velocity attachments remain
owned by the caller. The type-only public-import fix is published at `b32342b9`.
The original hardware 640×360 after-consumer fixture on `004e4b8a` retained 546 frames after
three real on/off cycles: final velocity targets/history/temporal stages/provisioning are zero,
console errors and warnings are zero, and the actual rendered frame is nonblank. Eleven of
twelve resource/cost assertions pass. The complete scenario **fails** its original p95 control
noise gate by **+0.625 ms** (1.2 ms allowance versus 0.575 ms maximum). Candidate overhead
passes, but that noisy control cannot qualify temporal-off cost. No threshold is relaxed.

The isolated normal merge of published `b32342b9` with develop `15adf350` preserves incoming
fluid/adapter, exposure/fog, assets and render-output ownership work. The actual Three source
merge is conflict-free; its canonical patch is `7036a173dfc11cb7d0a485c12eca4f3dcee3fa4e20c0a4a010b16741d81b79a2`.
A failing actual published-predecessor upgrade precedes regenerated full-blob migrations;
all 19 upgrade/idempotence/tamper tests then pass. Frozen offline install, the seven-package
JavaScript build, full workspace TypeScript, 255 focused CPU tests and 2,477 documentation
links pass. Scaffold hash changes are measured by the existing actual `createProject` test.
This merged source has no new runtime proof. The next bounded runtime request is the unchanged
three-toggle fixture with the original balanced cost protocol, under a coordinated quiet host
and the shared capture lease, retaining host-load evidence. Image-quality/ghosting, dynamic
resolution reconstruction, native rendering and performance acceptance remain open.
