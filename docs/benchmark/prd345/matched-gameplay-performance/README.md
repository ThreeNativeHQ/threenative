# Quiet matched gameplay performance

Three ABBA cycles per template, six fresh launches per arm, unchanged 1920×1080 performance scenarios and 33 ms p95 limit. Frozen local framework archives, source/assets/scenario/camera helper identity checks retained. Actual hardware WebGPU NVIDIA Turing, high tier. No owned concurrent builds during timing; external host activity and driver/OS caches uncontrolled. Exact camera snapshots were not requested by these unchanged scenarios: camera helper hashes match, but snapshot equality is unmeasured.

| Template | Original mean per-run p95 (sample sd) | Current mean per-run p95 (sample sd) | Passes original/current |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shooter | 29.23 ms (0.74) | 48.17 ms (2.50) | 6/6 / 0/6 |
| Snow | 33.83 ms (1.26) | 29.72 ms (3.26) | 1/6 / 5/6 |

Shooter has a repeatable whole-current-source regression in this setup; no individual shader/update cause is established. Candidate reports 102 converted materials, measured bright environment radiance ~0.548, extra fill not admitted. Snow retains authored fill with added fillGain zero and 19 conversions; its original template also frequently fails, and the current template is not uniformly below 33 ms. No threshold was changed, no best sample selected, no full-gameplay green claim.

Every per-launch outcome/sample count is in summary.json. Full summaries/source manifests/reports are compressed here; all original full PNGs remain in the durable local performance-controls1 tree, inventoried by image-manifest.json. Failed wrapper imports before measurement were retained separately; they produced no measured samples.
