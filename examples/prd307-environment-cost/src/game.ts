/**
 * PRD-307 Phase 1: what does `scene.environment` actually cost, and which half can baking win?
 *
 * The direction document attributes ~6.3 ms of an 18-19 ms Pixel 8 frame to `scene.environment`,
 * measured by turning it off. That ablation removes **two** costs at once, and only one of them is
 * something a build machine could have done earlier:
 *
 * | cost                                              | paid            | baking wins it |
 * | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
 * | the PMREM prefilter of the environment texture     | once at load    | yes            |
 * | every material sampling it, every fragment, frame  | every frame     | **no**         |
 *
 * So 6.3 ms is an upper bound on what baking can win, not an estimate of it. This fixture separates
 * the two by running the identical scene three ways, chosen with `?arm=`:
 *
 * - `static`   the environment is set once and left alone — the shipping case
 * - `dirty`    `needsPMREMUpdate` is set every frame, so the prefilter runs per frame — the cost
 *              baking removes, made continuously visible. `ProbeVolume` does this for real at
 *              `probe-volume.ts:937` after each cube-face sweep.
 * - `none`     `scene.environment` is null — both costs gone
 *
 * `dirty` minus `static` is what baking can win. `static` minus `none` is what it cannot.
 *
 * Nothing here decides how a game looks: it is a measurement fixture, and the scene exists only to
 * make environment sampling expensive enough to read on the meter. Read the numbers from
 * `TN_FRAME_BUDGET`'s `gpuMs`.
