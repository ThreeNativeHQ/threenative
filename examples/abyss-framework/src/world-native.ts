// Native entry for the `?world` fly-through (PRD-448 phase 4b). It is the same scene and the same
// logical package path as the web entry: `threenative build --target desktop` compiles
// `assets/world/` into content-addressed output and stages it beside the bundle with its
// `assets.manifest.json`, so `ctx.assets` resolves `world/world.json` on the host exactly as it
// does in the browser. PRD-448's `/world.json` override is gone with the reason it existed — the
// host had no manifest to resolve and the raw fetch needed a root-relative name.
