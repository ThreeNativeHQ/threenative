"""Strip the licensed Fab Scots pines down to the Temperate starter's triangle and texture budget.

Run headless, once per tree, writing into the example's own ignored folder:

    ~/.local/bin/blender -b --factory-startup --python scripts/prep-fab-pines.py -- \
        --source <fab>/Trees/ScotsPineTall_01/ScotsPineTall_01.glb \
        --out local-assets/prepared --species pine-tall \
        --near 6000 --mid 1500 --far 8 --impostor

What this is, and what it deliberately is not
--------------------------------------------
A driver, not a second implementation. Every measurement, cut and gate it uses
(card connectivity, the front-view coverage rasteriser, the exported-file
triangle gate) already exists in `scripts/prep-trees.py`, which was written
against the CC0 Poly Haven firs; this file imports it and overrides only the
three things the Fab files actually differ in:

  - the source is one self-contained `.glb` rather than a `.gltf` plus a `.bin`,
    so the import and the image extraction are different;
  - the crown is `ScotsPine_01_Leaves_Mat`, which is not in `prep-trees.py`'s
    needle hints, so the material split is named explicitly;
  - the atlas has to be *written out*, not merely unlinked. The CC0 fir's twig
    atlas is committed next to its model in the starter's own asset folder; the
    Fab atlas is licensed and cannot be, so it is downscaled to <=1024^2 and
    written beside the prepared GLBs into the example's gitignored
    `local-assets/prepared/`, and the game binds that copy by path.

The Fab tree is a far better candidate than the CC0 fir and the numbers say why:
ScotsPineTall_01's crown is 22,320 triangles of leaf *cards* 0.28-0.53 m
across, drawn from 116 atlas rects, and the near budget buys 4,800 of them -
about 21% of the crown, which is a crown rather than a haze. The fir was 0.3%.

The trunk is the other half of the answer to "trees still suck". The Fab trunk is
4,742 triangles of *modelled* bark including the root flare and the dead lower
limbs, against the procedural spruce's smooth tapered tube, and it is the part
that carries the eye down to the ground. It is decimated, not dissolved, and
given a cylindrical unwrap so the starter's own bark map still samples on it.

Three levels, and the far one is a cross-card
---------------------------------------------
near <=6000, mid <=1500, far = the 8-triangle four-quad cross impostor
`prep-trees.py` already bakes. The three stay independent copies of the
untouched geometry, so the near level is never a re-export of a thinned crown.

The gate is the EXPORTED FILE
-----------------------------
Every count in the summary comes from reloading the GLB this script just wrote
and parsing its JSON chunk, and the texture sizes from `os.path.getsize` on the
files it just wrote. A level over its triangle budget, a texture over 1024^2 or
over 1 MiB, or a card that rasterised to nothing raises and the script exits
non-zero. Nothing is reported that was not measured on disk.

# 7.4 to 20.1 m ones. At the meadow-close framing, where the eye is at 1.7 m and the nearest tree is
# a few metres away, a 0.36 m needle card on a 22 m tree is a plate across a third of the frame; on a
# 14 m one it is a spray. Scale is a decision about the picture, so it is made here, once, and every

# a 300x600 card, so no cut could ever reach the CC0 fir's 42% target and the

# is the *silhouette it had*, so both levels are held to a share of the source's
# own coverage: 35% at near, 30% at mid.
#
# And the share is measured at the resolution the level is *looked at*, which is

# cards; rasterised at 37 pixels per metre — a whole 14 m tree in a 512-pixel
# card — the survivors overlap and the crown measures 97% of the source's
# coverage, so the gate passes and nothing is enlarged. Rasterised at 110 pixels
# per metre, which is what a tree three metres from the meadow-close camera is
# actually drawn at, the same crown is a see-through spray. One number, two

# species. Both elevations are gated because one is half the problem: a crown stratified across
# its width alone covers a front view at any budget and collapses into a slab seen from the side.
#
# The share is one, not the brief's floor of 60% near and 50% mid. Those floors are satisfied by
# a crown you can see the sky through, and the brief's own instruction is to scale the survivors
# until the silhouette is preserved — a floor just stops the solve early, and stopping early is
# what produced the bare trunk with leaf confetti in the first place. What the triangle budget
# actually costs is card *size*, not silhouette: measured by sweeping the exported near level,
# growing the kept cards 1.33x covers 5.1% of the card, 4x covers 25.7%, and the uncut source
