// Every starter file this game can ask for, in one table.

// a game that ships its own models and maps rewrites these paths, or points them at a directory it
// owns, and nothing under `packages/terrain` changes. Nothing in this file loads anything — the
// loaders in `src/render/` ask for the paths, and a path that is absent leaves the surface on its
// own colours rather than failing the world.
//
// Two kinds of entry, and the difference is the caller's: a `map` is a PBR image the game binds,
// and a `model` is a placement asset a variant resolves to. Neither carries a scale, a material or
// a role decision; those are the render modules' business.

 * its own silhouette at the tree budget (`credits.json` has that number, and it is why the starter
 * kept its procedural spruce). The list and its loader stay because they are how the next source is
 * measured, and because a prepared file that is not there is not an error: this map is empty on CI,
 * on a fresh clone and in a review, and the procedural variants are what draw there.
 *
 * A species that IS added back comes in as one entry per detail level, because a variant with a near
 * level and no mid level is a variant whose middle distance pops. Three rocks at both of their levels
 * was six draws for stone the eye cannot tell apart at meadow distance, against the starter's
 * twenty-four-draw ceiling for the whole meadow — which is the trade this list now records.
