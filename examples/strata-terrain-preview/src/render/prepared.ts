// The prepared props of the Temperate starter, loaded as models: the CC0 rocks and firs that ship
// with the terrain package, and the licensed Fab Scots pine this example prepared for itself.
//
// What this file is: the bridge between a GLB somebody else authored and the starter's prop
// contract. A placement resolves to a variant, a variant resolves to parts, and a part is a
// geometry plus the role that decides its material. This file turns the prepared files into
// exactly that, and nothing else:
//
//   - the tree's trunk and branches are one role (`bark`) with the model's own unwrap, because the
//     game's bark map is sampled in UV and a trunk it cannot sample is a grey pole;
//   - the crown is one role (`pine`) cut against the prepared atlas;
//   - the far band is one role (`impostor`) cut against a card baked from the *uncut* crown, which
//     is the only version of this tree that survives being a few hundred pixels tall;
//   - the rocks carry no UVs at all, because the starter's rock surface is triplanar and a
//     photoscanned unwrap on a boulder is stripes;
//   - every part carries the `sway` attribute the wind reads, as a share of the prop's own height,
//     so the wind in `propMaterials.ts` moves a prepared tree exactly as it moves a procedural one.
//
// A file that is not there is not an error, and that is load-bearing rather than defensive. The
// licensed pine is prepared by `scripts/prep-fab-pines.py` into this example's gitignored
// `local-assets/prepared/`, so the folder does not exist on CI, on a fresh clone, or in a review;
// the starter ships a procedural spruce and a procedural boulder for exactly this reason. A game
// with no prepared art still has a forest. An unregistered asset id still fails by name, in
// `props.ts`, because that is a mistake rather than a missing optional file.
