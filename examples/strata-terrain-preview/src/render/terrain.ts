 * A five-point Laplacian over the baked samples, evaluated once on the CPU and stored as half floats:
 * `h(-1) + h(+1) + h(-w) + h(+w) - 4h(0)`, which is positive in a hollow and negative on a rib. The
 * divisor is the sample spacing squared, so the number is in 1/m and does not change meaning when the
 * world's resolution does, and the gain is chosen so a valley a few metres deep reads near +1.
 *
 * Half float rather than byte because the range matters: a byte would quantise the sign of a
 * near-flat field into blocks, and the sign is the whole of the answer.
 *
 * One curvature binding plus six albedos, four normals and four shadow maps is fifteen.
