// `SphereGeometry` with vertex noise on it is a ball with lumps; a boulder is a rock with facets
// that catch the sun along their edges, a flattened top where something rolled off it, a base
// buried in the ground so it grows out of the hillside instead of resting on it, and moss on the
// upward faces only, because moss does not grow on a vertical face.
//
// Grass is the other thing a cone cannot be. A blade is a tapered curved strip, dark at the root
// and light at the tip, and a clump is a handful of them at different angles — which is what makes
// a lawn read as depth rather than as a green plane with a texture on it.
