// The live ground is a `MeshStandardNodeMaterial`: six tiled layers blended by the world's own
// slope, curvature and painted splat, with a normal map projected on three axes and a noise
// gradient folded into its relief. A GLB carries no node graph, so none of that can travel.
//
// What travels instead is the same starter maps, chosen here rather than in a package, bound to the
// canonical baked uv, and weighted per vertex by the terrain's own splat through `vertexColors`.
// So a receiving game gets this game's CC0 albedo, normal, roughness and occlusion, this game's
// metres-per-tile, and this game's own layer weights as colour — a static bake of the appearance
// rather than a substitute for it.
