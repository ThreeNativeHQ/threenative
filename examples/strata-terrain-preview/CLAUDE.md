# AGENTS.md — Strata terrain preview

Read `/AGENTS.md` first. This example consumes build-baked arrays, not runtime recipes.

- Units are metres; Y is up; canonical heights are row-major Z then X, centred at zero.
- `scripts/bake.mjs` owns authoring. The game imports baked JSON and never evaluates terrain.
- Game appearance lives in `src/render/`; the ocean uses installed `SpectralOcean`.
- The ground's PBR maps are the CC0 starter sets in `packages/terrain/starter-assets/`, served
  through this example's Vite `publicDir` and loaded by `ctx.assets`; provenance is that folder's
  `credits.json`, and `src/render/terrain.ts` owns the layer, tile-size and blend choices.
- The forest uses the owner's licensed Project Nature Spruce Forest, Grass Library, Ground Foliage,
  Meadow Flowers and Fern Collection, plus Epic Kite Demo photoscanned rocks. `src/render/pack.ts`
  loads this example's gitignored `local-assets/temperate/`; `scripts/prep-fab-temperate.mjs`
  repairs atlas/opacity bindings and calls the installed asset cook. Set `FAB_TEMPERATE` to the
  imported library. Licensed bytes are LOCAL-ONLY and never committed; provenance is in `CREDITS.md`.
  Missing models keep the procedural spruce, rock, fern, grass and flower fallback drawing.
  All model sections share one whole-model scale/base. `src/render/props.ts` uses `InstancedBatch`
  with cooked reduced full-spruce geometry at distance and culls small cover beyond its readable range.
  `src/render/scatter.ts` plants noise-masked stands, clearings, edge saplings, and grass over the
  entire grass field, with denser cover at the walking/benchmark eyes.
- Use one `Heightfield` buffer for geometry and existing heightfield collision; do not resample.
- Ground contacts use actual mesh and physics queries. Bilinear heights are not triangle contacts.
- WASD/arrows move, Space jumps, C switches forest/coast, L changes sunlight. The player owns its camera.
- The live editor also takes environment, model, surface-image and sky-image edits (`src/render/imports.ts`, `surfaces.ts`, `environmentImages.ts`; inputs `bark.*`, `stone.*`); a mapping swaps the image inside a texture a material already samples, so it adds no sampler.
- The live editor and resolved static-world export proof are implemented; final starter art, complete GUI tooling and baked-water export remain subsequent PRD work.

Run `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:web` and
`pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:desktop` for the shared scenario.

Run `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:export` to produce the bounded
static PBR fixture and load it in an isolated vanilla Three.js project. Its checker
textures qualify interchange, not final starter art; unresolved river export first
fails, then the proof removes the river from its temporary document only.
Run `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:export:desktop` afterward to
load that same generated GLB in an ordinary native game with no authoring imports.
The native host must already be built; both runs use the existing playtest harness.

Every starter path lives in `src/world/terrainAssets.ts`; replace art by editing that table only, and
`pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:custom` proves the swap (zero starter requests, same
terrain arrays, a missing file fails by name; the ground samples 16 textures, so at most four layers
take a normal map). `pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:consumer` packs the terrain package and
re-authors every world `bake.mjs` exports in an install outside the workspace, runs the shipped
terrain-authoring workflow in a scaffold there, exports each world (and the GUI-polished fixture) as
a full-world GLB in a plain browser page, and hands the result to a scaffolded ThreeNative game that
builds and plays with no authoring package (`CONSUMER_GAME=skip` leaves that last stage out).
`pnpm --filter strata-terrain-preview test:terrain:authored` polishes a world through the editor's
real controls, reloads it and reproduces `scripts/fixtures/editor-authored.json` (`RECORD=1` rewrites it).
