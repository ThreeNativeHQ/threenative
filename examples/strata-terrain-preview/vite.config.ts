/**
 * The game's own licensed art, served beside the starter's.
 *
 * `publicDir` is one directory, and it is already the terrain package's CC0
 * starter sets. The prepared Fab pines are this example's own art, they are
 * licensed and cannot be committed, and they live in a gitignored folder that
 * only exists on the machine that ran `scripts/prep-fab-pines.py` — so they are
 * a second static root rather than a copy of the first. The Landscape Pro
 * vegetation `scripts/prep-landscape-pro.mjs` copies is a third, for the same
 * reason and with the same failure behaviour.
 *
 * A missing directory is not an error: the loaders in `src/render/prepared.ts`
 * and `src/render/pack.ts` treat a refused model as "this game has no prepared
 * art" and draw the procedural spruce instead, which is what CI gets.
 *
 * The Landscape Pro root serves a *path*, not a flat namespace, because a
 * cooked pack model names its own textures as `../../../shared/images/<hash>` —
 * reproducing the asset pipeline's own layout is what lets a GLB copied here
 * resolve its images without being repacked. The traversal check is therefore a
 * per-segment test rather than "no separator anywhere".
