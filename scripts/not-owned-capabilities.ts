Call ik.update(targets) once per frame after AnimationPlayer/mixer and before render, with one world-space metre position per effector in order plus an optional quaternion only where the effector declared orientation: true; it never starts a loop, never moves the root and installs no bone translation or root-motion controller. Joint limits are X/Y/Z offsets relative to the animation pose supplied that call, so reapply the animation pose before solving to avoid accumulation, and the solver only rotates: bone lengths hold to under 1e-15 m. Iterations are 1-128; an unreachable goal returns converged false with finite residuals and never throws, a solver failure restores the original pose, and dispose() at scene teardown.
