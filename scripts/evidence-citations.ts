  // or `assets/textures`, `sweep-evidence.ts:92` only *classifies a name*. Meanwhile the real
  // reader is stronger than any of them. `collectEvidenceFiles` (`sweep-evidence.ts:399`)
  // recursively walks an archive root and inventories every regular file; `writeEvidenceManifest`
  // SHA-256s each one and `verifyEvidenceManifest:530` fails two ways — `evidence file missing
  // from archive` for a deletion, `Unlisted evidence file in archive` for an addition. An archive
  // is a hash-sealed unit whose inventory *is* the directory, so the file-level reader for every
  // subpath is that walk. `sweep-archive.ts:5` imports both.
  //
  // Two honest caveats, recorded rather than glossed:
  //   1. **The seal protects nothing today.** `git ls-files 'docs/benchmark/sweeps/*/

  //      `classifyStoreChild` leaves it untouched. The entry is justified by the contract the
  //      tooling enforces going forward, not by a manifest that exists now.
  //   2. **This blankets the tree**, which the other entries deliberately avoid. It is defensible
  //      here because the untracked half never reaches the scanner, and the arm sources that *are*
  //      tracked — the 13 archives a `sweep-*.md` ledger names — are read by `measure-sandbox.ts`
  //      (`:306` src, `:216` starter-baseline/src, `:102` framework-types) when
  //      `sweep-delta.spec.ts` and `sweep-ledger.spec.ts` recompute the measurement. So everything
