/**
 * The lighting stages a generated game already has, described in the words someone would use
 * before they know the name.
 *
 * These are not package exports, so nothing puts them in the manifest automatically: they are TSL
 * nodes composed by `src/render/postprocessing.ts`, which is generated source the game owns. The
 * result was that `engine_search_capabilities("light shaft through a window")` returned nothing
 * while the stage had been shipping, tuned, and documented for months — and the cost of that gap
 * is measured in this repo's own history: a scene was built with hand-authored cone geometry for
 * beams the render chain was already drawing.
 *
 * The manifest is the thing an agent searches first, so a stage absent from it does not exist.
 * Each entry therefore carries the situations in plain words, and the constraint that actually
 * bites — for godrays, that the beams and the haze are separated by `godraysFloor`, not by
 * `godraysIntensity`.
