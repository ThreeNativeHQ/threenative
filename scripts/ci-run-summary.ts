/**
 * Writes the run summary PRD-296 item 3 asks for: every job's verdict, with a skipped job saying
 * **skipped** and why, rather than being indistinguishable from a pass at a glance.
 *
 * The board is the failure mode this addresses. When three gates were ordered behind a
 * permanently red one they were skipped on every run in the repository's history, and a skipped
 * check reads as an absence, not a red. The `main protection` ruleset makes that worse rather than
 * better: a skipped required check counts as satisfied.
 *
 * Reads the workflow for the job graph and the `needs` context for the results, so it names the
 * upstream that caused a skip instead of asserting one.
 *
 * Usage: `tsx scripts/ci-run-summary.ts --workflow <path> --results <json file>`, where the JSON
 * is `${{ toJSON(needs) }}`. It prints markdown on stdout; the workflow appends it to
 * `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.
