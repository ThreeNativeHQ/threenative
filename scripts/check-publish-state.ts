/**
 * `pnpm publish:check` — the preflight that makes a stale publish impossible.
 *
 * Four packages went up by hand on 2026-08-09 and three never went up at all. Nothing computed a
 * version bump, nothing failed when a package was edited without one, and npm does not permit
 * republishing a version that exists — so the only way that ends well is a check that refuses the
 * tree before anybody runs `pnpm publish`.
 *
 * It answers four questions, and fails closed on each:
 *  - is every publishable workspace package in the publish set, or is one silently missing?
 *  - has any package's `src/` moved since the version it still carries was published?
 *  - did a `catalog:` or `workspace:` specifier survive into a manifest that ships?
 *  - does every publishable package carry a README that its own `files` list would include?
 *  - does every relative import of every shipped script resolve inside the packed tarball?
 *
 * A registry it cannot reach is not a pass. It exits `2` — `pnpm alpha:bar` uses the same rank,
 * where `2` means the question was never answered.
