// frame. golden-path proves that a stranger can scaffold, install, build and play — its runner has
// no GPU, and the pixel scenarios it cannot serve are already covered by test-browser and visuals.
//
// The split is derived from the scenario files, never listed here: a scenario is visual when it
// captures a screenshot or names a baseline image. A hand-maintained list is the drift that leaves
// a newly added pixel scenario running on a machine that cannot render it.
