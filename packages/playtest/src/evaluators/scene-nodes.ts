/**
 * Bounds on named nodes of the scene graph.
 *
 * `emitScene` bounds the room: is anything lit, does the fog clear the world. This bounds one
 * object, which is what an agent otherwise takes a screenshot to find out — where the crate is,
 * whether it is inside the camera's frustum, whether its texture ever loaded, whether the mesh
 * is visible once every ancestor's flag is counted. Each of those kills a frame while every
 * count above it stays healthy, and a screenshot can show the damage without naming the cause.
 *
 * Every branch fails closed. A run whose bridge reported no scene nodes has not reported a
 * visible crate; it has reported nothing.
