 * rule is the only thing separating "this run leaked a browser" from "a neighbour is working".
 *
 * A rule that matched `playwright_chromiumdev_profile-` anywhere on the machine reported another
 * lane's live browsers as this run's orphans: a red on a clean tree, cleared by nothing the diff
 * could change. These drive the rule directly against decoys so both halves stay proven — the
 * neighbour is ignored, and this run's own leak is still caught.
