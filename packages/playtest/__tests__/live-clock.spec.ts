 * `--live-clock`: the browser half of what the native production profile's own `--live-clock` does
 * there. A standing scene cannot be measured on counted ticks — the runner batches `waitTicks` into
 * `advance()` calls that present no frames, so a game that stands still reports one boot window and
 * nothing after it. The switch puts the clock request ahead of every page script, and the run says
 * which clock it measured on, because a rate off the wrong clock is not a rate.
