# @threenative/playtest

Run a schema-version-1 browser scenario against any development URL:

```bash
npx @threenative/playtest playtests/movement.playtest.json \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:5173 --server-command "npm run dev"
```

Install the bridge from `@threenative/playtest/three` when semantic entity, camera,
movement, or visibility assertions are required. Browser-only input, screenshot,
DOM, console, network, and trace evidence does not require an adapter. Run
`npx @threenative/playtest init` to create a config, smoke scenario, and adapter
example without changing application source.

Pass chromium flags with `--browser-arg`, repeated once per flag. A WebGPU
target does not start without them:

```bash
npx @threenative/playtest playtests/movement.playtest.json \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:5173 \
  --browser-arg --enable-unsafe-webgpu \
  --browser-arg --enable-features=Vulkan
```

## Doctor

```sh
npx @threenative/playtest doctor --text              # can this machine run a playtest?
npx @threenative/playtest doctor --url <url> --text  # and what is in the game running there
```

## Native targets

The same scenario format runs through `--target browser`, `--target android`, `--target desktop`,
or `--target ios`. A desktop run launches a caller-supplied packaged native game executable,
creates a temporary local mailbox, and removes it with the child process when the run ends:

```bash
npx @threenative/playtest playtests/device-smoke.playtest.json \
  --target desktop --executable .threenative/build/ThreeNative
```

The native host receives the mailbox root through `TN_PLAYTEST_MAILBOX_ROOT` and injects the
shared `TN_PLAYTEST_MAILBOX` global before evaluating the game entry, so the game source is
unchanged. On Linux without a display, prefix the command with `sh scripts/xvfb.sh`.

An iOS simulator run installs a built app, launches it with `simctl`, and
uses the app data-container mailbox:

```bash
npx @threenative/playtest playtests/device-smoke.playtest.json \
  --target ios --app build/threenative-ios.app \
  --bundle-id dev.threenative.runtime --device booted
```

For a signed physical build, add `--ios-transport device --device <devicectl-id>`.
Network, DOM, and `assert.visual` assertions are unsupported on device targets and fail
`TN_PLAYTEST_UNSUPPORTED_ON_TARGET` with exit code 2. Default CI does not run Android or
iOS device scenarios. `.github/workflows/native-platforms.yml` is an explicit opt-in
platform lane; an absent run is not a pass.

## What a passing run means

A scenario only reports `pass` when at least one assertion was evaluated
against an observation that actually arrived. Assertions fail closed: a missing
entity, an absent resource, an empty effect log, or a scenario with no
assertions at all is a failure, never a silent pass. Wrong-typed assertion
values are rejected when the scenario loads rather than dropped, so a scenario
cannot quietly run with fewer checks than its author wrote.


## Tone gates and offline inspection

`npx @threenative/playtest tone shot.png other.png` prints tab-separated rows for mean, p1, p50,
p99, clip%, black%, plus an unweighted frame-average row. No browser is started. Empty input,
unreadable PNGs and images without visible pixels exit 2 without a partial table.

```json
{ "assert": { "tone": [{ "atStep": "landed", "mean": { "min": 60, "max": 140 }, "p99": { "min": 150 }, "clipFraction": { "max": 0.005 } }] } }
```

`atStep` selects a named step; omission selects the final capture. Every metric takes inclusive
min/max bounds. Empty arrays, empty bounds, non-finite/out-of-range numbers, unknown keys and
reversed ranges fail at load. Missing capture evidence fails TN_PLAYTEST_TONE_UNOBSERVED.
Failed bounds name the measured and required values.

All six metrics use the capture guard's existing PNG decode without downsampling: rounded
Rec.709 display luminance fills 256 bins; mean averages bin values and percentiles use nearest
rank. Clip/black fractions count bins 255/0 and use 0..1 in assertions (percentages in the CLI).
Fully transparent pixels are excluded; other pixels retain stored RGB without compositing.
These numbers measure exposure, not aesthetic quality.


Browser, Android, desktop and iOS scenario captures now record TN_TONE under observations.tone,
even without tone assertions. Explicit tone requests force their captures despite disabled
convenience screenshots. A named step's existing screenshot is reused. This host-side support
is exercised with target-driver fixtures; it does not turn unit tests into native GPU proof.
