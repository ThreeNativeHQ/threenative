# Capture the frame — screenshots that actually render WebGPU

Companion to the `Budget real time for the look` section in this project's `AGENTS.md`. Run
`pnpm dev`, then get eyes on the game. In rough order of preference:

1. **Browser automation against the user's real Chrome**, if you have it — Claude in Chrome
   or any equivalent MCP browser tool. This is the best option by a wide margin: it runs on
   a real GPU, so WebGPU works, and you can navigate, press keys, screenshot, and read the
   console in the same loop you are already coding in. Drive the game, do not just load the
   menu.
2. **`npx @threenative/playtest <scenario> --browser-recipe webgpu --headed`.** The recipe
   carries the Chromium flags a WebGPU capture needs, including `--enable-features=Vulkan`.
   Do not hand-roll the flag list: without that one flag Chromium never reaches the Linux
   Vulkan driver and serves WebGPU from SwiftShader, its CPU rasteriser — no error, healthy
   limits, and a software renderer's picture. The runner fails such a run with
   `TN_PLAYTEST_SOFTWARE_ADAPTER` and prints the adapter it got; `--allow-software` accepts
   the fallback if you truly want it.
3. **Ask the user to look**, and say specifically what you want them to check.

## Virtual displays

On a machine with no screen, run any of those under a virtual display. **Do not use
`xvfb-run`:** on `xorg-server-xvfb` 21.1.x its cleanup `kill` fails after Xvfb has already
exited and that failing kill's status replaces the real one, so
`xvfb-run -a -s '-screen 0 1600x900x24' true` exits `1`. Every gate wrapped in it reports
failure whether it passed or not. Start `Xvfb` yourself on a free display and export
`DISPLAY`, or check the command's own exit code separately.

## Headless Chromium usually cannot render WebGPU

The page loads, the HUD paints, and the 3D canvas comes out blank or black. That looks
exactly like a bug in your scene, and it is not. Symptoms are `Instance dropped in
popErrorScope` and `createBuffer failed, size (N) is too large for the implementation` in
the console.

So: if a screenshot comes back black or empty, suspect the capture before you rewrite the
scene. Confirm the renderer works at all before you go debugging your materials.

## The silhouette checklist

1. **Look at it.** Boot the game, get the thing on screen, take a screenshot, open the
   screenshot. Reading your own diff is not looking at it.
2. **Silhouette first.** Can you tell what it is from its outline alone? Break up long
   straight edges — overhangs, fringes, props crossing the line.
3. **Give it depth.** Something bright behind it, something dark under it. Contact shadows
   and a rim make a prop sit in the world instead of floating on top of it.
4. **Make it move.** Idle bob, a squash on impact, a particle on pickup, a screen shake on
   damage. A few frames of motion is the cheapest quality-per-line in the whole project.
5. **Finish the HUD too.** Spacing, hierarchy, a transition on every number that changes.

When you think you are done, ask yourself, honestly: *would a player screenshot this?* If
the answer is no, you are not finished — and no command in this project is going to tell
you that.
