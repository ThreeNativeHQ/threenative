## When the framework blocks you, write plain Three.js

An API in `@threenative/*` that is broken, missing, or does not do what you need is **not
something to wait for or to work around from inside its shape.** Drop to vanilla Three.js —
or to the plain code that does the job — for that one thing and keep building. Your `src/`
is ordinary source; nothing in `@threenative/*` reads it, so a hand-written `THREE.*`
implementation sitting beside a framework API is a supported outcome, not a hack.

1. **Scope the fallback to what actually blocked you.** Keep the loop, scenes, input, entity
   registry and playtest bridge; replacing all of them because one node misbehaved costs far
   more than it saves.
2. **Keep the fallback portable.** Plain Three.js and plain math run on native. `document`,
   `window`, `localStorage`, dynamic `import()`, and a raw physics handle do not — reach for
   one of those and this part of the game is web-only from then on.
3. **Report what blocked you**: the API, what you expected, what happened, and what you
   wrote instead. That is how the gap gets fixed for the next game; a silent workaround
   leaves it in place.

Never contort the game to flatter the framework, and never stall on a framework bug. A
finished game carrying a plain Three.js patch beats a blocked one every time.
