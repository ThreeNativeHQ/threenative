## The `ctx` surface — you already have these, do not rebuild them

`ctx` carries six things that get reimplemented by hand in almost every project, because
they are **properties on `ctx`, never imports** — grepping an existing file's imports will
never surface them. This table covers only the `ctx` properties; call
`engine_search_capabilities` for imports. The recipes behind this table live in
`agent-docs/ctx-cookbook.md`.

| You already have | Rather than | Signature |
|---|---|---|
| `ctx.goto("<scene-name>")` | a hand-written `#reset()` | `(name: string) => Promise<void>` |
| `ctx.tween(obj, { y: 2 }, 0.4, { ease: ... })` | a `Math.sin` / `lerp` accumulator | `(target, props, seconds, options?: { ease?: (progress: number) => number }) => Promise<void>`; optional fourth `options` argument; `ease` receives progress from 0 to 1 and returns the interpolation factor |
| `ctx.after(0.8, fn)` | `elapsed += dt; if (elapsed > 0.8)` | `(seconds, cb) => ScheduleHandle` |
| `ctx.every(fn)` | a per-frame branch in `update` | `(cb: (dt: number) => void) => ScheduleHandle` |
| `ctx.random.range(-1, 1)` | `Math.random()` | deterministic when `seed` is configured; otherwise `Math.random()` |
| `ctx.raycast()` / `ctx.raycastAll()` | `new Raycaster()` + `intersectObject(s)` | `(options?: { screen?, origin?, direction?, far?, targets?, exclude? }) => Intersection \| undefined` / `readonly Intersection[]` |

Three rules are load-bearing enough to stay here:

- **`ctx.goto(name)` rebuilds the scene without resetting game state.** Values in `ctx.state`
  survive the rebuild; reset your own state explicitly when death-and-retry should start
  fresh:

```ts
if (player.dead) {
  ctx.state.set({ /* copy this game's initial-state shape */ });
  ctx.state.flush();
  void ctx.goto("<scene-name>");
  return;
}
```

- **One rule when calling it from a frame function: `goto` and then `return`, immediately.**
  Everything after the call runs against a torn-down scene.
- From React, `game.goto("<scene-name>")` also rebuilds the scene, but it resets the game's state
  to its declared initial state first — that is the full restart button; `ctx.goto()` is for
  preserving game state across the rebuild.

**`ctx.random` is deterministic only when `defineGame({ seed })` is configured.** Never use
`Math.random()` for a value the scenario must reproduce.

**Reinvention fails CI.** `pnpm budgets` scans this project's `src/` for these raw
constructs and fails, naming the capability instead. The list and the gate are generated
from the capabilities' own doc tags, so they cannot disagree:

| Rather than write | Use instead | Import from |
|---|---|---|
| `new Audio(` | `AudioBus` | `@threenative/core` |
| `Math.random(` | `createRandom` | `@threenative/core` |
| `new Box3().setFromObject(` | `normaliseToMetres` | `@threenative/core` |
| `.visible = false` | `prewarm` | `@threenative/core` |
| `new Raycaster(` | `ScenePicker` | `@threenative/core` |

When the raw construct is genuinely right, annotate that exact line with a non-empty
reason — a bare `// engine-override:` still fails:

```ts
const bounds = new Box3().setFromObject(viewmodel); // engine-override: measuring, not scaling
```
