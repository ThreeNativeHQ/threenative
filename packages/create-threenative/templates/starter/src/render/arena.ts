// The prototype test arena every engine opens a new project on, and the one shape every platform
// in it is cut from: a light metre-grid plate on top of a dark-grid body that reaches the ground.
// Two meshes, so the walking surface reads as floor and the sides read as structure — and two
// solids, so the player collides with exactly the triangles they can see.
//
// Every solid here is **placed in the geometry, not on the mesh**, for one reason: `worldGridUVs`
// measures UVs in world metres, and a trimesh collider built from that geometry is the exact
// surface the player sees. Move a solid by rebuilding it here, not by writing `mesh.position` —
// a collider reads the mesh transform and the shape separately, and the two only agree while the
// mesh sits at the origin.
