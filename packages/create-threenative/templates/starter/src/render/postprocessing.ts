// Generated for you: ordinary Three.js; ThreeNative does not read this file.
//
// This file wires two things together and decides nothing itself. `quality.ts`, in this folder,
// owns which stages run at which tier and records what each one measured. `WorldEnvironment`,
// also in this folder, builds them and prints `TN_WORLD_ENVIRONMENT` naming every stage as
// applied or refused **with a reason**, so a stage that silently no-op'd is never mistaken for
// one you turned off.
//
// To make the game cheaper or prettier everywhere, edit `quality.ts`. To force one tier for one
// run — a desktop that is dropping frames, a capture you want to compare — pass it:
// `setupPost(renderer, scene, camera, { tier: "low" })`. Overriding does not silence the report:
// `TN_QUALITY_TIER` names the tier that ran either way.
