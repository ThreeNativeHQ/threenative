//
// The last two stages of this game's frame: a colour grade, and the film grain over it. Both are
// *authored* stages — `postprocessing.ts` hands their factories to `WorldEnvironment`, which owns
// the order, the tier and the report, so `TN_RENDER_CHAIN` names each one as applied or refused
// with a reason instead of this file guessing whether it ran.
//
// The table in `public/grade.cube` is this game's, written by `tools/make-grade-lut.mjs`. Replace
// that one file with any `.cube` from any grading tool and nothing else here changes. `quality.ts`
// owns how strong the grade is, how much grain there is, and which tier runs each.
//
// **Why `afterOutputTransform`.** A `.cube` table is authored against the picture a person sees:
// sRGB, tone-mapped, 0–1. This stage therefore reads the frame *after* the output transform and
// asks the chain to install the graph with the renderer's automatic transform switched off — the
// same arrangement three's own FXAA example uses. `renderOutput` below is the pipeline's own
// tone curve and encode, applied once and by hand, so the frame keeps exactly one output
// transform whether this stage runs or not.
//
// The alternative, mapping scene-referred light onto the table's domain and back, was measured and
// dropped: an 8-bit table quantises in 1/255 steps, and no bijection of the two-parameter family
// recovered the frame to within one 8-bit step per channel — the best of them cost 2.0, and
// `(x/W)^g / (1 + (x/W)^g)` with `W = 4, g = 1/2.2` cost 4.3. `__tests__/grade.spec.ts` holds the
// arithmetic; the value of the transform's own seat is that an identity table there is under one
// step by construction rather than by a fitted curve.
