// Nothing here is textured, on purpose. Surface variety comes from alternating

// A hand-rolled seeded PRNG used to live here, and it was a line-for-line copy of the
// `createRandom` the framework already exports — same multiplier, same increment, same
// sequence. It is gone. Nothing in this folder may import a framework package (that is what
// keeps `src/render/` portable Three.js), so a scene builds the seeded source and hands it
// down: see `createScenery` below and its caller in `src/scenes/Play.ts`.
//
// Never `Math.random` for anything the world is built from. The world has to be byte-identical
// on every reload or a screenshot diff cannot tell a bug from a reroll, and `ctx.random` is
// what a playtest reads to prove the level was seeded at all.
