// Three rooms in a row, cut from the prototype test scene: a light metre-grid floor, dark-grid
// walls, bevelled pillars, and a doorway between each pair. The layout is the same three rooms the
// game has always had — the same x-range, the same spawn, the same boss at the far end — so every
// scenario and every state path still describes real behaviour; only the masonry is new.
//
// **One `Group` per room.** The scene hands each one to `buildStaticColliders`, so a room is the
// unit of both the look and the collision: a designer who cuts a fourth room out of this file gets
// a fourth room that is solid, with nothing else to remember.
