// Every solid in the dungeon is one bevelled box, and every prop is a small assembly of them.
// Two rules make them read as made objects instead of blockout:
//
// - A 3 cm rounded edge catches a line of sun and a line of sky. Sharp edges catch neither.
// - The block sinks by its bevel radius. Resting the rounded bottom on the floor leaves a lit
//   sliver under it, and the shadow reads as detached from the thing casting it.
