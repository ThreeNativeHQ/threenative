/**
 * Everything the HUD reads, and nothing it can derive for itself.
 *
 * The simulation owns the rules; the UI is a mirror. Two rules follow. First, the *rules table*
 * (`TYPES` in `src/sim/types.ts`) is not published: the panel imports it and reads a unit's name,
 * role and cost from the same source the pathfinder does, so a rebalance cannot leave the HUD
 * quoting last season's numbers. Second, a value that changes every frame is counted or rounded
 * here rather than sent raw, because the store is cloned whole for every playtest observation and
 * a per-frame vector of sixty positions would cost more than the game it measures.
