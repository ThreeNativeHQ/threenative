  // frame. Both fetches run together, or the ship's own load would reopen exactly that gap one
  // scene hop later: `Boot.enter()` calls `goto("sailing")` without awaiting it, so the registry
  // is read the instant `Boot.enter()` returns — not once `Sailing.enter()` eventually does. See
  // `loadSky` and `loadShipModel`.
