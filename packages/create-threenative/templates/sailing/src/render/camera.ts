/**
 * Where the camera sits relative to the ship: astern, up, and a little out to starboard.
 *
 * The distance and the height are one decision, not two. At 7.4 m astern and 3.7 m up the lens was
 * 27 degrees above the water and the ship filled half the frame: its rail was at the bottom edge
 * and the player never saw the whole of what they were sailing. The shot this wants is a third
 * person chase — the whole ship, and a strip of sea ahead of the bow to steer by — and that is a
 * distance and a lens height together, because the aim point is what sets the horizon and the two
 * of them are not free. These three numbers put the horizon at about 235 px of 720, a little under
 * a third from the top, and the ship's masthead comfortably inside the frame.
 *
 * The height is raised rather than dropped for the sake of the ship's waterline. A lens near the
 * surface looks *along* the sea, and a 13 m swell running under a 4.3 m hull puts a trough either
 * side of every crest: from low down, the water immediately in front of the lens is often half a
 * metre below the hull's own waterline, the line of sight to the keel clears it, and the whole
 * bottom of the boat hangs in the air in front of the sea behind it.

 * The offset used to be a constant in world axes, which was fine while the ship could only travel
 * along -Z. Now that the helm turns the hull, a fixed offset means the camera watches the ship
 * from whatever side it has turned towards: sail west and the shot is the transom, sail east and
 * the bowsprit comes at the lens. Rotating the offset by the heading keeps the rig against the
 * sky, which is the shot this game is about.
 *
 * The position is eased and the aim point is not. Easing the aim as well makes the horizon lag
 * the turn and the whole frame swim; easing only the position gives the camera the weight of
 * something being towed astern while the ship stays where the player put it.
