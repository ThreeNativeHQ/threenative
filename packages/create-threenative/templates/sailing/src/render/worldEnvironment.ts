// `WorldEnvironment` is Godot's name for the node that says which lighting effects a scene
// runs and how strong they are, and the property names below are Godot's `Environment`
// properties where Godot has one (`ssr_enabled`, `glow_enabled`, `tonemap_mode`) and
// Three.js's node names where it does not (`ssgi`, `gtao`). Nothing here is a new word.
//
// What it owns: building the stage factories and handing them to
// `renderer.createRenderChain()`, which decides the order stages run in, whether each can
// run on this target, and prints `TN_RENDER_CHAIN` naming every stage as applied or
// refused **with a reason** — so a stage that silently no-op'd is never mistaken for one
// you turned off. What it does not own: any colour, and any strength that is not a quality
// tier. Those are arguments, supplied by `postprocessing.ts`, yours to change.
