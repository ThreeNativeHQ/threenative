// of the scene is lit by: its brightness had to be hand-computed with a `pow(dot(n, sun), 30)`
// term standing in for a specular highlight. Water is one of the few surfaces where the specular
// *is* the material, so that read as plastic.
//
// A spectral ocean is cascaded wave spectra inverse-transformed on the GPU every frame, which is
