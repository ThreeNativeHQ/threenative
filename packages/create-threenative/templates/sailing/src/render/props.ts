/**
 * Where each sail hangs in the ship model's own space, and how big it is.
 *
 * The cloth cannot be a child of the hull: `SoftBody3D` detaches itself permanently the moment it
 * is removed from the scene, and `ctx.add` is what attaches it to the renderer — so parenting it
 * to the ship after adding would tear it down on the same frame. It lives at the scene root and
 * `Ship` carries each one to its yard every frame instead. These are the yards.
 *
 * `ship.glb` is authored close to real-world scale (a ~22 m hull), unlike the caravel this
 * replaces (a ~6 m one), so every number here is in the *model's own* raw units, which
 * `Ship#trimSails` carries through `model.matrixWorld` — the same normalisation factor that
 * shrinks the hull to 4.6 m shrinks these to size. `x`/`y`/`z` were found by bucketing the source
 * mesh's own vertices along its length: the mainmast sits at raw x ≈ -1.5 (tallest, top ≈ 22.7),
 * the foremast at raw x ≈ 6.5 (top ≈ 20.2), both well inside the hull, with only a low, thin
 * bowsprit reaching past it at the +x end — so bow is +x there, and the +90° yaw in
 * `createShipModel` turns that into this game's -z bow, which is why a source +x becomes -z here.
 * There is no third mast in the source geometry the same scan could find, so the mizzen below is
 * placed proportionately aft of the mainmast, at the caravel's own mainmast-to-mizzen fraction of
 * the hull's remaining length, and wants the most visual re-checking of the three.
 *
 * `width`/`height`/`belly` are **not** the caravel's own numbers: `ship.glb`'s hull is half the
 * caravel's beam for its length (measured — see `measureHull`), and a sail sized for the wider
 * hull draped past the bow and covered the whole ship. Each is the caravel's final, on-screen size
 * rescaled by this hull's own beam ratio (0.51), then converted back to this model's raw units by
 * the same factor as `x`/`y`/`z`.
