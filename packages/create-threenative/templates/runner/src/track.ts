/**
 * One recycled slice of track.
 *
 * The road, the rails, the obstacle geometry and the obstacle material are built once and then
 * moved. `InstancedBatch` places `MAX_OBSTACLES` slots at construction and `build()` hands back
 * the `InstancedMesh`; a recycle rewrites that mesh's matrices and parks the slots it does not
 * need. An earlier version built a fresh batch per recycle and only `remove()`d the old mesh,
 * which in Three.js frees no GPU memory at all — every obstacle-bearing recycle leaked a
 * geometry, a material and an instance buffer, forever, on exactly the ten-minute run the
 * comment used to boast about.
 *
 * **The obstacle bodies are the exception, and are not recycled.** `RigidBody3D` has no
 * reposition API for a fixed body, so each recycle disposes the chunk's bodies and creates new
 * ones. They are disposed, so nothing leaks — but the claim is "the render side allocates
 * nothing", not "nothing allocates".
