// One material per role, shared by every mesh that plays that role, so the whole vault is a couple
// of dozen draw-call-sharing surfaces rather than four hundred unique ones. Surface variety comes
// from alternating entries, never from a bitmap: `CanvasTexture` samples BLACK under
// `WebGPURenderer`, and a flagstone seam drawn as geometry reads correctly on every target.
//
// The room needs more tints than `palette.ts` has roles, so they live here, beside the material
// that wears them, and `palette.ts` keeps the six that are contracts rather than choices.
