// warden, the pile, the phase crates and the seal are all supposed to be legible on the first
// screen, and a camera that trails the character loses two of the four every time it moves.
//
// It still breathes. `settle` eases the framing in over the opening drop, and `nudge` lets the
// shot drift a fraction of a metre toward the warden so the picture is not completely static.

   * The yaw is the part that matters, and about twenty degrees is the window. An axis-aligned shot puts the near wall across the bottom of
   * the frame as a flat band and flattens the whole room into a rectangle; swinging the camera
   * onto the corner is what makes the left wall recede and gives the picture the diagonal the
   * reference is built on; past thirty the room reads as a diamond with dead corners.
   *
   * The numbers are solved rather than eyeballed. Four attempts at nudging them by hand each cost
   * a build and a screenshot and each landed with the room cropped on one side; projecting the
   * room's eight outer corners through this exact camera and binary-searching the distance found
   * a fit in one pass. Yaw 17 degrees, elevation 41, the room spanning 1.84 of the 2.0 of clip
   * space vertically — so the near wall is just cropped, as it is in the reference — and biased a
   * little right of centre, which is where the HUD is not.
