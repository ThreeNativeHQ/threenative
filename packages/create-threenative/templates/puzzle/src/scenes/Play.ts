 * to the backend — measured: after a pose reset and ninety settling steps the pile was still
 * 0.80 m from the pose it had been handed. So "put the world back and run it again" can only be
 * done by destroying the bodies and building new ones — and *that* changes the order the backend
 * hands out handles, which changes the simulation. Rebuilding forty-four crates has two stable
 * outcomes that alternate: the two passes disagreed by 0.2818 m on 220 of 308 recorded components,
 * to the same sixteen digits on every run, and swapped places when a throwaway rebuild was moved
 * from one side to the other.
 *
 * So the check runs on a rig small enough to be built identically twice, in a vault emptied for
 * the duration: the warden shoves one crate into a stack of two. It is a real character push
 * against real contacts under the same fixed step — and it is three bodies, which is why
 * `replayBodies` is published beside the verdict rather than left for a reader to assume.
