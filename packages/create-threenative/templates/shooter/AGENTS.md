# AGENTS.md — __PROJECT_NAME__ first-person arena shooter

Instructions for the AI agent in this game. `CLAUDE.md` mirrors this file; edit `AGENTS.md`.

## Ownership

ThreeNative owns bootstrap, renderer, fixed-step loop, input, loading, physics bindings, and the state bridge. This repository owns the arena, weapons, waves, HUD and look; `src/game.ts` is
portable, `src/main.ts` is the web-only React mount. The render camera also skips an object that projects under **0.5 px** in it; `renderer.minimumProjectedPixels` raises that threshold (`false` disables the cut, not the count) and `alwaysRender(object)` exempts an object, while camera-attached objects and shadow casters are kept. The engine also owns the per-frame world-matrix walk, and by default it does not descend into a hidden subtree — so a game that reads a hidden object's `matrixWorld` directly must use `getWorldPosition` (or call `object.updateWorldMatrix(true, false)`) first; `renderer.matrixWorld: "all"` restores three's every-node walk, and `TN_PROJECTION` reports the visited-node count either way.

## Start every change

1. **Critical planning gate:** invoke `threenative-capabilities` before `prd-creator`. Search
   `engine_search_capabilities` for the full request and each concrete mechanic, inspect matches
   with `engine_capability_detail`, and record a capability or no-match for the plan. Apply the `ponytail` ladder before writing code; never hand-write what the capability search already installs.
2. Then invoke `prd-creator`. Draft the plan around those capabilities and binding constraints,
   direct the user to review it, and wait for explicit approval plus an instruction to implement.
3. Treat returned constraints as binding. `@threenative/physics/navigation` is browser-only WASM;
   use the direct physics queries already in this kit instead of a navmesh or distance scan.
4. If a build, import, device, or blank frame fails, run `npx threenative doctor` and
   `npx @threenative/playtest doctor`; missing observations are not zero.
For *"a bullet passes through a wall"*, `RigidBody3D` defaults to continuous collision; `continuousCollision` is the named per-body override, and `body.continuousCollision` reports the effective setting on web/native.

## When the framework blocks you, write plain Three.js

When an `@threenative/*` API is broken, missing, or does not do what you need, replace only that
piece with portable Three.js. Keep the loop, scenes, input, registry, and playtest bridge; avoid DOM
globals, dynamic `import()`, and raw physics handles. **Report what blocked you** (API, expectation,
result, replacement); never stall the game.

## Workflow skills

- `.agents/skills/prd-creator/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/prd-creator/SKILL.md` — game plan and approval gate.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-capabilities/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-capabilities/SKILL.md` — capability search.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-playtest/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-playtest/SKILL.md` — diagnosis and proof.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-assets/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-assets/SKILL.md` — assets and sculpting.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-visuals/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-visuals/SKILL.md` — captures and look.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-performance/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-performance/SKILL.md` — measured budgets.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-ui/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-ui/SKILL.md` — native-safe UI.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-context/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-context/SKILL.md` — portable ctx APIs.
- Confirmed framework bugs: use `file-engine-bug` in `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` after a minimal repro. Lazy-first: `.agents/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` — smallest correct change, and its reuse rung is the capability search above.

## Commands and map

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm build --target desktop
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
```

Contract: clear five waves to win; zero lives loses. Mouse looks, WASD moves, click or F fires,
right-click or Q aims, R reloads, shift sprints, ctrl/C crouches; G projectile, E radius blast,
V wall probe, H damage, X lethal, enter restarts. Use `ctx.physics.directSpaceState` for
hitscan/radius/target scans. `src/weapons/` owns combat, `src/scenes/Play.ts` wires it,
`src/ui/Hud.tsx` is the only HUD, `state.ts` publishes lives/wave. Keep
`playtests/survives.playtest.json` as smoke proof; rewrite the other combat examples.

## Portable authoring contracts

Leave `assets` absent: the cook selects target-decodable passes, with `models.sharedImages: true` deduplicating images. `sharedImages: false` embeds duplicate copies; `models.compact` (default `{ flatten: true, join: true, instance: true }`) flattens the scene graph, merges primitives by material and batches a mesh shared by several nodes as `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` — all lossless, keeping any node matching `protectedPattern` (or named in `protectedNames`), an animation target, or a skin joint individually addressable; `compact: false` ships the scene graph as authored. `models: "none"` / `textures: "none"` / `audio: "none"` skip those passes and report uncooked bytes. Android/iOS currently skip compression and model dedupe. `assets.exclude` defaults to `[]`; source-relative globs (for example `["unused/**"]`) omit matching files and report saved bytes. `assets.budget` accepts `{ uncooked?: number | "none", total?: number | "none" }`, default `{ uncooked: 64_000_000, total: "none" }`: only bytes left uncooked where cooking was possible count toward `uncooked`. A number sets that ceiling; `"none"` disables both gates. Either disabled gate still reports bytes. Automatic texture cooking retains unaligned source images unchanged and reports `block-size`; those bytes still count toward the uncooked budget. An explicit compression codec override must satisfy four-pixel block alignment; `codec: "none"` opts out. Cooking never silently resizes an image to fix alignment.

Relative look capture: a binding with `pointerRelative: true` captures the canvas on click by default; set `captureOnClick: false` and call `ctx.input.captureMouse()` from your own gesture to opt out. Desktop mode precedence is CLI (`--windowed`, `--maximized`, `--fullscreen`) over `display.fullscreen` over `window.maximized`; with both false, `window.width`/`height` size the normal window.
First person, four rules: place the camera in `afterPhysics`, never the frame function, or the eye sits one step behind the body and shots land in the floor on stairs; start every shot at
`player.aimRay()`, where the crosshair is, and let `Viewmodel.converge` lean the weapon to meet it;
the trigger takes `pressed` and `justPressed`, because the cooldown makes the cadence and the edge
catches a click the harness delivers no other way; `src/render/scale.ts` is the only size table.

Scenes use `load`, `enter`, `update`, `exit`, `render`; physics nodes are Godot-named and disposable.
Generated conventions call `GroundSnap` for floor contact, `normaliseToMetres` for authored scale,
`attachToBone` for held props. `input.vector("move").y` is +up, so forward uses one explicit
`-move.y`. Rigged assets: put a `.glb` in `assets/`, await `ctx.assets.model("hero.glb")` in `Scene.load()`, drive `AnimationPlayer` beside its entity. `ctx.goto(name)` rebuilds without
resetting game state (from a frame function, `goto` then `return`); `ctx.state.set({ … })` is a
partial patch; `game.goto()` rebuilds and resets. Seeded randomness needs `defineGame({ seed })`.

`src/render/quality.ts` owns `low`, `medium`, `high`; `isMobile()` picks `low`, otherwise `high`;
override with `setupPost(..., { tier: "low" })`. Unknown tiers throw, `TN_QUALITY_TIER` reports the
source, and the bridge flushes about 100 ms — keep lives/wave in state, feedback in Three.js.

When an animation looks wrong, measure it before rewriting it: `clipPoseError` scores a retargeted
clip per bone in degrees relative to each rig's own bind pose, `clipTrackBindings` names tracks that
bind nothing (the `<bone>.undefined` failure that plays the bind pose), `clipBoneCoverage` names
bones the clip does not drive, and `boneContact` reports whether a bone reaches its prop. Two loading conventions come from `@threenative/core`, not from your own loops: `loadAll(items, load)` fetches six at a time and returns results **in the input's order** (a pool that pushes returns completion order, so a positional pick lands a different asset every load), and `addInSlices(objects, (object) => ctx.add(object))` attaches 256 per presented frame so hundreds of objects never land in one long frame; override `concurrency`/`sliceSize`, pass `while: () => alive` to stop a torn-down scene without throwing, and `marker: false` silences `TN_LOAD_ALL`/`TN_ADD_SLICES` but never the measurement.

## Budget real time for the look — see `node_modules/create-threenative/agent-docs/references/dream-loop.md`

Open a capture after visual changes; a scenario with no assertions or missing observations fails.
VFX appearance belongs in `src/render/vfx.ts`: its TSL material, geometry, colour, blend, curves,
timing and capacity. Gameplay creates `GPUParticles3D` or an `IComputeDriven` object once, adds it
with `ctx.add`, and calls `restart()` from the real fire or hit path; never move appearance into
core or replace the event with a demo-only caller. The engine warns you before a human does: `TN_SCENE_WARNING` fires when the GPU used under a third of the frame while the JS render phase ran longer than the display's own period, and names the census behind it — objects considered, draws per pass, triangles per draw, shadow-exempt casters. It is a scene-shape verdict, so answer it by moving the draw and object counts, not the engine: read the bucket census before promising a merge. `npx threenative doctor` repeats the last verdict and the `DEV_MODE=true` chip shows it beside the frame rate; `TN_FRAME_SPANS=1` adds the render phase's own span tree when you need to know which part costs the milliseconds. The cheapest static object is one whose transform you never write: measured on 1,561 objects, leaving them alone costs 10.10 ms of render phase against 17.45 ms when the game rewrites every transform each frame, because three skips the per-object binding update when nothing changed. So do not touch a transform you do not need to — that is worth ~7 ms where `markStatic(root)`, which additionally composes a never-moving subtree once, measured 0.009 ms. Use it for scenery you are sure of, and `invalidateStatic(object)` to announce a write inside one; it deletes matrix arithmetic, not the walk. `TN_RENDERLIST_VALIDATE=1` recomputes every world matrix the long way each frame and throws on the first that disagrees, which is how you prove a freeze did not leave something stale on screen.

On a touch-primary device, `src/render/touch-controls.ts` adds a movement stick, a look stick, and fire, aim, reload and crouch pads; the stick pushed to its rim sprints. Keyboard is the fallback.
## Optional multiplayer transport
For online play only, import `connect` from `@threenative/core/net` with an HTTPS URL and nonempty identity credential; configure `connectTimeoutMs`, `maxReliableMessageBytes`, `maxQueuedReliableBytes`, and `maxQueuedDatagrams` (10s/65,536/1 MiB/256), use `reliable-ordered` for ordered reliable messages and bounded `unreliable` datagrams that may drop, and keep serialization, replication, prediction, interpolation, snapshots and rejoin in this game's `src/` and server. There is no fallback: unsupported WebTransport/native rejects with `TN_NET_UNAVAILABLE`; reference Go server: `packages/runtime-native/examples/webtransport/server`.
