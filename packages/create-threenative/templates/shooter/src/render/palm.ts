// Date palms for the Bayview waterfront, built as real geometry.
//
// A palm is recognised entirely from its outline, so this file spends its
// vertices on the three things that outline is made of:
//
//   1. a slender trunk that LEANS — Mediterranean date palms never stand
//      plumb — tapering 0.37 m at the root flare to 0.21 m under the crown,
//      with stepped bark rings where old frond bases sheared off;
//   2. nine to thirteen pinnate fronds whose pitch rotates from upward at the
//      base, through horizontal, to drooping well past it at the tip, each one
//      a run of swept leaflets so the edge reads as a saw-tooth rather than a
//      cut-out rectangle;
//   3. the crown junk under it: a skirt of dead brown fronds and two or three
//      hanging date bunches, both cheap and both unmistakably palm.
//
// Everything is deterministic (`makeRandom`, never `Math.random`) so a replay
// renders the same tree twice, and the whole run of trees is drawn from three
// prototype geometries through `InstancedMesh` — a palm is a repeated prop, and
// generating fresh geometry per placement is how a prop budget disappears.
//
// Colour variation is baked into a vertex-colour attribute instead of extra
// materials: frond tips read sun-bleached, frond bases shaded, and the bark
// grooves darker, all inside one draw call per part. (CanvasTexture samples
// black under WebGPURenderer, so a painted gradient is not an option here.)
