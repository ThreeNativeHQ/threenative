// The Bayview town itself: an 84 m whitewashed Mediterranean block laid out
// per docs/bayview-design.md — CT spawn north, T spawn south, A site west,
// B site east, mid in the centre, raised decks (back plat, heaven, catwalk),
// the waterfront dock, crates, barrels and palms between the lanes. The palms
// themselves are geometry-heavy enough to own a file: see `palm.ts`.
//
// Buildings form continuous street walls along every lane (the references are
// dense white blocks, never scattered boxes), heights step between neighbours
// 5–9.2 m with setback storeys and slim towers, every roofline carries a
// parapet plus water tanks / AC boxes / antenna masts / vents, and every
// lane-facing face gets blue doors, shutter pairs, balconies and striped
// awnings from one deterministic hash so replays render identically.
//
// Everything solid goes into `hittable` (the raycast stops there) and gets a
// collider; raised decks sit overhead so ground navigation ignores them while
// their posts still block it. Site letters are built from boxes because
// CanvasTexture samples black under WebGPURenderer.

 * The yellow panel van, parked against a T MAIN street wall.

 * have. The T-spawn opening view is a straight shot up x = 0 to the mid plate
 * at (0, 9.9); a 1.9 m van hugging x = 2 leaves five centimetres of that
 * sightline, which is a bug on a bomb map, not a prop. So it parks on the
 * lane's other continuous wall, TW's east face at x = −12, where:
 *
 *   * the body clears the wall by 0.47 m and the mirrors by 0.30 m, which is
 *     more than the 0.22 m a facade door surround stands proud;
 *   * the east flank stops at x = −9.2, so the mid-plate sightline is clear by
 *     over nine metres;
 *   * the T-main plate at (−11.9, 22) stays 1.2 m clear to the south, and the
 *     approach to it from T spawn never crosses the van;
 *   * the palm at (−10.6, 27.2) is four metres further south — the previous
 *     candidate spot was straight through it;
 *   * the nearest patrol leg, the west rover's (−16, 10) → (−7, 18), passes
