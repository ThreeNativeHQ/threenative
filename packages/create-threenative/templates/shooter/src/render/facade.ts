// Bayview's building faces. `town.ts` owns where the blocks stand; this file
// owns what a wall looks like once you are standing in front of it.
//
// The reference frames are not white boxes with blue rectangles painted on
// them. Every opening is a hole with thickness: a near-black reveal sunk into
// the wall, a proud stone surround (jambs, lintel, sill) around it, and the
// leaf sitting well back behind that surround so the sun cuts a hard line down
// one jamb. Three extra boxes per opening buy all of it, and the shadow in the
// reveal is most of the effect — a door drawn flush on the plaster reads as a
// decal from every angle a player can reach.
//
// Four rules this file lives under:
//
//  1. `CanvasTexture` samples BLACK under `WebGPURenderer`, so nothing here is
//     ever painted procedurally. Corrugated roller doors are modelled as real
//     ribs, the painted dado is a real proud band, and variety comes from
//     alternating palette entries.
//  2. Determinism: every placement is driven by `hash(seed)`, never
//     `Math.random()`, so a replay renders identically.
//  3. Budget: facade detail multiplies by ~50 lane faces. Every piece is
//     accumulated into a `FacadeBatch` and merged into ONE mesh per material at
//     the end, so the whole town's joinery costs tens of draw calls rather than
//     the ~900 individual meshes it would otherwise be.
//  4. Dressing never gets a collider. The batch's meshes go into `hittable`
//     (a bullet stops on a door, as before) but no `TownCollider` is emitted
//     for any of it — a proud window sill must never be something a player
//     snags on.
//
// The one thing here that is not dressing is `addArchGateway`: the round-headed
// passages through a building are the most identity-bearing piece of
// architecture in the reference set, so those are real solids with real
// colliders on their piers and on the mass over the opening.
