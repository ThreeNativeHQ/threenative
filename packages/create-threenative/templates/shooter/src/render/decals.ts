/**
 * Bullet holes, and any other flat mark a game wants to leave stuck to a wall.
 *
 * ## Why the marks have to persist
 *
 * A hole that fades after half a second is worse than no hole: the player learns their rounds
 * land nowhere. So the pool is large — a couple of hundred marks, recycled round-robin — and the
 * oldest quietly gives up its slot rather than every mark expiring on a timer.
 *
 * ## Why plain meshes and not an `InstancedMesh`
 *
 * One instanced draw call is the obvious implementation, and it does not draw at all here. This
 * engine does not hand the renderer the authored scene; it maintains a mirror of it
 * (`SceneRenderProjection`), and an `InstancedMesh` goes into that mirror's "exact lane" as a
 * shallow proxy. Marks written into the source's instance buffer never reached the screen —
 * verified with an opaque red probe at four times the size, which was equally invisible while the
 * placement counter climbed and the logged positions were correct.
 *
 * Each slot gets its own cloned material, and that is deliberate rather than wasteful. The mirror
 * batches renderables that share a geometry *and* a material into an `InstancedMesh` of its own —
 * straight back into the path that does not draw. A distinct material per slot keeps every mark on
 * the mirror's exact lane, which does. Splitting the pool by variant on top of that is what gives a
 * hole in steel a colder rim than one in wood.
 *
 * ## The offset
 *
 * A decal sitting exactly on the wall z-fights with it, and the artefact is a shimmering ring
 * that reads as a rendering bug rather than a hole. Every mark is pushed `offset` metres along
 * the surface normal instead — `polygonOffset` is the usual answer and it is not dependable
 * across WebGPU pipelines.
