/**
 * Whether a sight line is blocked, answered from the world's collision boxes.
 *
 * ## Why not a raycast
 *
 * This started as `ctx.raycastAll` against every solid mesh in the town, run once per soldier per
 * frame. Measured across five soldiers it cost 15.4 ms of a 16.3 ms frame — the whole mid-round
 * hitch, in one call. A raycast has to walk a scene graph, update world matrices, build or consult
 * an acceleration structure per geometry, collect every hit and sort them, and it does all of that
 * to answer a question with one bit in it.
 *
 * The town already publishes exactly what a sight line cares about: `TownCollider`, the axis-
 * aligned boxes that stop the player walking through walls. A segment against an AABB is the slab
 * test — six divides and a few comparisons, no allocation, no traversal — and it stops at the
 * first box that blocks. A couple of hundred boxes come out in microseconds.
 *
 * ## Why this is also more correct
 *
 * The raycast tested render meshes, so a soldier's line of sight could be broken by a handrail, an
 * awning, or a plate of thin dressing that a player can plainly see through, and the old code
 * carried a `userData` special case to unpick one of those. Sight is now blocked by precisely what
 * blocks movement: if you cannot walk through it, you cannot see through it. That is one rule with
 * no exceptions list, and it is the rule the level was built around.
 *
 * Purely decorative geometry no longer occludes. That is the intended trade: a soldier who spots
 * you through a railing is a fair fight, and one who loses you behind a drainpipe is a bug report.
