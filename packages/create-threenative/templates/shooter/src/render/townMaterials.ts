// Bayview's surfaces, in the engine's default look: a light metre grid for the
// ground, a dark metre grid for everything built, and one saturated blue for
// the props you can push, hide behind or shoot.
//
// ## Why there is no texture in this file
//
// The town used to be dressed in Bayview's own colour / normal / roughness /
// AO photographs, sampled triplanar from world position so a tile was the same
// size on every wall. That is a good look and it is not this template's look:
// it shipped ~23 MB of images with every scaffolded project, and a first-person
// shooter is judged on whether it runs, not on whether its stucco has relief.
//
// So the whole texture branch is gone. What remains is three materials from
// `./materials.js` — the same ones `minimal` opens every project with — and
// `worldGridUVs`, which is what makes one grid tile one metre on a face of any
// size. The geometry is unchanged: same buildings, same quay, same decks, same
// routes. Only the dressing moved.
//
// ## What still exists, and why
//
//   * The three grid materials are SHARED across the town, so `town.ts` and
//     `facade.ts` still hand every solid one of a small set of materials and
//     the projection keeps batching them.
//   * Water, palms, fronds and the scoring plates keep their own flat
//     materials. A metre grid across the sea reads as a bug, and a target that
//     looks like a wall is not a target. They are content, not dressing.
//   * `worldGridUVs` has to be called on geometry that is already in world
//     space, which is what `facade.ts` and `vehicles.ts` do before merging and
//     what `town.ts` does per solid. Calling it on a shared unit box would give
//     every solid in the town the same tile, so those meshes now carry their
//     own geometry.
