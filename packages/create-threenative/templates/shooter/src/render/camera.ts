// screenshot and the one thing every change to the fight touches: where the eye
// sits, how wide it sees, and how far it shakes when a round lands.
//
// A spring arm is the obvious thing to reach for and it is wrong here — the eye
// is welded to a head that physics already solved, so smoothing it only ever
// puts the crosshair somewhere the body is not. The rule this file exists to
// state is the opposite one: compose the camera from the body's *solved* pose,
// every frame, with no interpolation of its own.
