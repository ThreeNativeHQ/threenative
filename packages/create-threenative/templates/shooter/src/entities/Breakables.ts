/**
 * Props that come apart when you shoot them.
 *
 * ## Why this is worth having
 *
 * A world where every round lands on something immovable teaches the player that shooting has
 * no consequence outside the scoreboard. One pot that bursts into shards which then bounce down
 * the steps does more for how a weapon feels than any amount of tuning on the weapon itself.
 *
 * ## The two halves
 *
 * `BreakableField` owns mechanism: intact props, the shard pool, the physics bodies, and the
 * lifetime that returns a shard to the pool. `KIND_STYLES` below is this game's content and can
 * be replaced wholesale — a different game keeps the field and writes its own pots.
 *
 * ## Real bodies, borrowed briefly
 *
 * Shards are actual dynamic Rapier bodies, so they land on the steps and pile against walls
 * instead of falling through the world. But a dynamic body is a permanent cost in the
 * simulation, and a round is a hundred-odd seconds of shooting — so a shard's body exists only
 * while the shard is moving. `SHARD_SECONDS` after the break, the body is disposed and the mesh
 * goes back to the pool. That keeps the live-body count bounded by `maxLiveShards` however many
 * pots the player shoots.
 *
 * The shard meshes themselves are allocated once, up front, at zero opacity and in the scene —
 * building a mesh mid-round is the WebGPU pipeline stall recorded in `Rifle` and `gunfx`.
