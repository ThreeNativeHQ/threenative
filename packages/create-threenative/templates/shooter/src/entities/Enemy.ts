/**
 * The rifle every soldier carries, built from five boxes.
 *
 * ## Why it is written rather than downloaded
 *
 * The old rig carried a rigged AK-47 with retargeted Mixamo clips, which meant a second skinned
 * asset per soldier, a `Grip_Bone` to align against, a magazine bone to read a muzzle from, and
 * a 90-line pose table translating one weapon's animation into another's. The mannequin has no
 * weapon socket and no rifle clips, so all of that was solving a problem the template no longer
 * has — and shipping ~1 MB of AK geometry into every scaffolded project to do it.
 *
 * Five boxes read as a rifle at the distances a soldier is ever seen from, cost twelve triangles,
 * and normalise to `scale.rifleLength` like any other prop. The grip is the holder's own origin,
 * so the right hand lands on it by construction and there is nothing to align afterwards.
 *
 * ## Layout, in metres, along the barrel (+z is the muzzle)
 *
 *   receiver   0.42 long, centred at z 0.06   the body and the sight line
 *   barrel     0.30 long, centred at z 0.40   thin, forward
 *   magazine   0.14 long, below at z 0.02      the tell that reads as "rifle" from the front
 *   stock      0.24 long, behind at z -0.26    what puts the shoulder line in the right place
 *   grip       0.10 long, below at z -0.04     the block the fist closes around
 *
 * ## The hold
 *
 * `hand_r`'s own axes run *down the arm*, so the rifle's barrel (+Z) has to be turned toward the
 * left hand and its sights toward the sky in that bone's space. Where that is depends on the
 * clip, so `RIFLE_HOLD` carries one rotation per rifle clip and `#holdRifle` applies it on every
 * clip change; `rightHandContact` and `leftHandContact` (engine `boneContact`) prove both fists
 * reach the gun.
