/**
 * The chassis geometry, in metres, in the chassis's own frame. `VehicleBody3D` reads Godot's
 * `VehicleWheel3D` names; these are its values.
 *
 * The numbers are measured, not guessed. `packages/physics`'s AGENTS.md records the three Rapier
 * facts this file depends on, and the tuning was done against them on the real backend:
 *
 * - `suspensionStiffness` is **mass-normalised** — a frequency squared, so the strut sags about
 *   `gravity / (4 * stiffness)` and Godot's default of 20 bottoms the suspension out. At this
 *   world's `-24 m/s²` and 220 that is 27 mm of the 240 mm strut.
 * - A wheel ray must not hit the chassis it hangs from, or the car rides its own collider.
 * - `speed` is the seam's own signed forward speed, not Rapier's `currentVehicleSpeed()`.
 *
 * Measured on this geometry (620 kg, 17 m/s top speed): 0 → 15.04 m/s in 3.33 s and a settled
 * 17.00 m/s terminal; 15.04 → 0 in 0.65 s over 4.75 m; a full-lock input at 15 m/s settles into a
 * 7.6 m radius corner without spinning; 0 → 11.1 m/s in 2.5 s from rest on full lock, which is the
 * "turns on the spot without spinning" case; an 80 mm kerb lifts the car 8 mm and costs no speed,
 * and a car at 17 m/s stops at a wall without passing through it.
