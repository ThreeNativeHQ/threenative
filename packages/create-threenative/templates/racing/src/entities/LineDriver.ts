 * does", and both cars on the circuit use it — the rival, and the autopilot the playtest presses.
 * That is deliberate: a scenario that wants a car to lap the circuit cannot do it with recorded key
 * timings, because a chassis with suspension and weight transfer answers a fixed key script
 * differently on every corner. It can do it by pressing the same button the rival's controller
 * obeys, and the result is a lap that is a **consequence** of the physics rather than a timing
 * that happens to be near the road.
 *

 * is to the driver's right, and a positive Rapier steering angle is to its left.
