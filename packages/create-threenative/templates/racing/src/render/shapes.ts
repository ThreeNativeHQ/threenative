// series of cross-sections along the car's length instead, which is how a real body is drawn, and
// it costs about the same number of lines.
//
// Every colour, roughness and metalness arrives as an argument. Re-livery the car by editing
// `materials.ts`; change its shape by moving the numbers in `CAR_STATIONS`. Neither needs the
