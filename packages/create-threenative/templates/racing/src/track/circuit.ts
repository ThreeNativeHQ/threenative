/**
 * The circuit, once.
 *
 * Every other thing on this track — the road mesh, the kerbs, the run-off, the barriers, the pit
 * lane, the lap gates, the sectors, the rescue points, the rival's line and the autopilot's line —
 * is read off {@link CIRCUIT}. The old build drew the road as boxes between five hand-typed route
 * points and drove a *different* curve, and the two drifted: the racing line bulged 4.5 m off the
 * tarmac and the rival drove into the tyre walls. There is one centreline here, and nothing else
 * in the template is allowed to name a coordinate of its own.
 *
 * ## The layout
 *
 * One lap, 830 m, read anticlockwise in the x/z plane (`+x` east, `+z` south):
 *
 * | s | what it is |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | 0-130 m | the main straight, where the grid, the gantry and the pit lane stand |
 * | 130-215 m | T1, a fast right sweeper onto the east side |
 * | 215-290 m | the run down the east straight to the hairpin |
 * | 290-400 m | the hairpin: 180 degrees, the tightest radius on the circuit |
 * | 400-450 m | the left that puts the car on the return leg |
 * | 450-520 m | the return leg, 70 m of it |
 * | 520-590 m | the esses, two opposite kinks either side of the centreline |
 * | 590-660 m | the west-side corner onto the back straight |
 * | 660-780 m | the back straight and the run to the last corner |
 * | 780-863 m | the last corner, which is what feeds the main straight |
 *
 * The layout was **measured, not eyeballed** (`.runtime/racing/cc.mts` walks the same points):
 * 863 m round, the tightest radius 14.6 m at the hairpin, the closest two parts of the circuit
 * ever come 25 m of centreline with 43 m of arc between them, and an ideal lap at the tyres'
 * lateral limit of 51 s. That is why the lap lands in the 40-70 s band on a car whose top speed is
 * 17 m/s, and why the circuit is 863 m and not the 1.2-2 km of a real Grand Prix track: at this
 * car's pace a 1.2 km lap is 70 s of nothing but straights.
