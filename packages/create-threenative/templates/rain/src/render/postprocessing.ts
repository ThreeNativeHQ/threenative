// Generated for you: ordinary Three.js; ThreeNative does not read this file.
//
// This is the storm's filmic half — the demo's own `BLOOM` and `POST` passes, ported rather than
// approximated. `bloom-shader.ts` and `post-shader.ts` hold the maths, transpiled from
// `tools/tempest-bloom.frag` and `tools/tempest-post.frag`; this file owns only where those two
// runs and what feeds them.
//
// Every engine stage that would double a job the demo's own pass already does exactly is off:
// `quality.ts` decides those, and the built-in bloom is a mip pyramid rather than the demo's 5x5
// quarter-resolution threshold kernel. The engine's tone curve and sRGB encode are applied by the
// render pipeline *after* the graph, so the demo's ACES fit, its grade and its `pow(1/2.2)` would
// otherwise be applied twice — hence `NoToneMapping` and the working colour space below, which is
// what the source's own Three.js driver sets for the same reason.
//
// To change how the storm looks, edit the two `.frag` sources and run the generator. To change how
// much of it there is, edit `quality.ts`.
