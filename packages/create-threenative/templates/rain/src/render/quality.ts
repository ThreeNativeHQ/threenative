//
// This is the one place this game decides how expensive it looks. Two tables live here:
//
// - `low` / `medium` / `high` are the engine render chain's tiers, which `postprocessing.ts` reads
//   through `qualityPreset(resolveQualityTier(...))`. This study turns **every built-in stage off at
//   every tier**: its bloom, ACES grade, vignette, lens beads and dither are the source study's own
//   single post pass, installed as one authored stage, so a built-in bloom or tone map would do the
//   same job a second time. What differs is the rung the chain reports and runs at
//   (`renderChainTier`), so a stage you add later with a `minimumTier` drops out on the cheap tiers.
// - `STUDY_TIERS` is the player's "Render quality" select — the reference study's own four tiers,
//   `performance` / `balanced` / `high` / `ultra`, number for number: the cloud pass's resolution
//   share and march steps, the rain budget, and whether wet surfaces run the 36-step reflection
//   march. The drawing buffer itself is the engine's adaptive resolution (`resolutionScale: "auto"`
//   in `threenative.config.ts`), which measures the frame instead of trusting a fixed table.
