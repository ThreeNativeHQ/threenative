// Generated for you. Ordinary Three.js, and the falling rain lives in this file.
//
// The reference study drew every drop in one vertex stage: six vertices per drop, the drop's own
// seed hashed from its index, its position wrapped inside a 66 x 30 x 66 metre cell that follows the
// camera in 12 metre steps, and its two endpoints projected by hand so each quad comes out stretched
// along the drop's own fall. That maths is transcribed below, constant for constant, and it is the
// rain: no sprite sheet, no texture, no particle simulation on the CPU.
//
// The engine owns the frame loop, the scene and the renderer, so this file owns three things — the
// uniforms, the geometry, and its own lifetime — and draws nothing itself. No render loop, no raw
// GL, no `@threenative/` import, so the same file runs wherever the game runs.
