// Generated for you. Ordinary Three.js, and the whole coastal look lives in this file.
//
// The coast is not a set of meshes. It is one raymarched distance field — terrain, the road down
// it, the double yellow line, the sea, the island, the forest, the six lamps, the rail, the cabin
// with its lit window and its antenna, the wet reflections and the rain ripples — evaluated in the
// fragment shader, which is why the whole thing is a single screen-sized quad. Its maths lives in
// `world-shader.ts`, which `tools/generate-shaders.mjs` transpiles from GLSL; this file
// owns the camera basis, the weather uniforms and the sky it reflects, and nothing else.
//
// Conventions: one world unit is one metre, +x is out to sea, -z runs down the coast.
