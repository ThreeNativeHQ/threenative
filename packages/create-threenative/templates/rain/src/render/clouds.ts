// The clouds are not part of the coast's raymarch: the source rendered them into a screen-sized
// target first and handed that target to the world shader as its sky and its wet reflections, which
// is what makes the reflections carry the same cloud shapes the sky does. This is that pass. The
// shader itself is `clouds-shader.ts`, transpiled from `tools/tempest-clouds.frag`; the maths of the
// volume is there and the only decision here is where the march happens.
//
// The pass is a `PassNode` over a scene holding one screen quad, so the engine's own renderer owns
// the render target, its size and its per-frame update — there is no second render loop here, and
// nothing about the target is copied out by hand.
