// Generated for you: ordinary Three.js; ThreeNative does not read this file. Delete or rewrite
// it freely — the tiers below are a starting point, not a framework look.
//
// This is the one place this game decides how expensive it looks. `postprocessing.ts` reads
// `qualityPreset(resolveQualityTier(...))` and nothing else, so "make it run on a phone" is one
// file to edit rather than a hunt through anonymous literals.
//
// **Every millisecond here is a reading, and every gap says so.** The figures come from the
// per-stage ablation recorded in the engine repository's `docs/verification/runtime-perf-state.md`
// (Chrome on an RTX 2080, 1600x900, static build, `gpuMs` from three's `timestamp-query`), where
// the whole five-stage chain costs 12.5 ms of a 14.7 ms frame and the same frame with every stage
// off costs 2.2 ms. The per-stage figures oversum — removing SSGI also removes the denoise passes
// the later stages sample — so read each as *what turning this one off gave back*, not as a share
// of a partition. A stage nobody has ablated on its own says `unmeasured` rather than guessing.
//
// One cost that is **not** a stage here and outweighs most of them: the prefiltered reflection
// probe on `scene.environment`, measured at ~6.3 ms of an 18-19 ms Pixel 8 frame. It is set in
// `sky.ts`, not in this file.
//
// This level is bright: a photograph sky at full range, ~2,300 small meshes, one sun and no
// screen-space colour work. `playtests/performance.playtest.json` is the proof of the numbers
// below — read `TN_FRAME_BUDGET` back after you change a tier rather than trusting these.
