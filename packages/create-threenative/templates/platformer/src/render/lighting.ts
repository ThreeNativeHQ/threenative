// hemisphere or ambient light next to an image-based environment fills the same faces twice and
// flattens exactly the shadow side the sun was there to make. The low-poly geometry keeps its own
// separation through `flatShading` and baked vertex mottle, which is why this level reads as
// facetted without a second light.
