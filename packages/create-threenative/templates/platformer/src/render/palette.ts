// `palette` is the six roles the render layer shares: the loading screen's two sky bands, the
// distance the horizon fades into, the two colours a walkable surface is made of, and one
// saturated `accent` that marks everything the player can touch. Rename a role and every user of
// it moves with it, which is the point — there is no second copy of "the green" anywhere.
//
// `C` is this game's own colour table for the procedural models below it. A fox with a jacket, a
// gold coin and a red mushroom cap needs more than six colours and pretending otherwise buys
// nothing: these are named per part, so swapping one creature's fur never touches a rock.
