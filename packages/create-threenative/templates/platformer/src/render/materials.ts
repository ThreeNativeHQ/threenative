// cloth), and `mottle` is how a flat box becomes mottled stone with no texture at all.

 * colour are different materials. That is what lets a whole scenery subtree be merged into one
 * draw per material: two meshes in one bucket must agree on every attribute, and a bucket that
 * half its pieces cannot see is a bucket that silently loses the mottle.
