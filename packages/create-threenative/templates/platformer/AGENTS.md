# AGENTS.md — __PROJECT_NAME__ platformer

Instructions for the AI agent in this game. `CLAUDE.md` mirrors this file; edit `AGENTS.md`.

## Ownership

ThreeNative owns bootstrap, renderer, fixed-step loop, input, loading, physics bindings, and the
state bridge. This repository owns the level, character feel, enemies, pickups, checkpoints, HUD,
and look; `src/game.ts` is portable and React mounts from `src/main.ts`.

## Start every change

1. For any game request, invoke `prd-creator` first. Present its concise game plan, direct the user
   to review it, and wait for explicit approval plus an instruction to execute or implement it.
2. Then search `engine_search_capabilities` for the full request and each
   concrete mechanic; record a capability or no-match before writing a replacement.
3. Treat returned constraints as binding. `@threenative/physics/navigation` is browser-only WASM;
   the chasers use editable routes so desktop/native remains honest.
4. If a build, import, device, or blank frame fails, run `npx threenative doctor` and
   `npx @threenative/playtest doctor`; missing observations are not zero.

## When the framework blocks you, write plain Three.js

When an `@threenative/*` API is broken, missing, or does not do what you need, replace only that
piece with portable Three.js/plain code. Keep the loop, scenes, input, registry, and playtest
bridge; avoid DOM globals, dynamic `import()`, and raw physics handles. **Report what blocked you**
(API, expectation, result, replacement); never stall the game.

## Workflow skills

- `.agents/skills/prd-creator/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/prd-creator/SKILL.md` — game plan and approval gate.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-capabilities/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-capabilities/SKILL.md` — capability search.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-playtest/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-playtest/SKILL.md` — diagnosis and proof.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-assets/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-assets/SKILL.md` — assets and sculpting.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-visuals/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-visuals/SKILL.md` — captures and look.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-performance/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-performance/SKILL.md` — measured budgets.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-ui/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-ui/SKILL.md` — native-safe UI.
- `.agents/skills/threenative-context/SKILL.md` / `.claude/skills/threenative-context/SKILL.md` — portable ctx APIs.
- Confirmed framework bugs: use `file-engine-bug` in `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` after a minimal repro.

## Commands and map

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm build --target desktop
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
```

`src/entities/Character.ts` owns movement and feel; `Patrol.ts` follows a route and `Chaser.ts`
uses the authored avoidance path; `src/level/` owns platforms and checkpoints; `src/render/` is
ordinary Three.js; `src/ui/Hud.tsx` is the one HUD. Keep `playtests/survives.playtest.json` as smoke
proof and keep `touch-controls.ts`/`touch-layout.ts` aligned with the native playtest.

## Portable authoring contracts

Scenes use `load`, `enter`, `update`, `exit`, `render`; physics nodes are Godot-named and disposable.
`input.vector("move").y` is +up, so forward uses one explicit `-move.y` conversion. Rigged assets:
put a `.glb` in `assets/`, await `ctx.assets.model("hero.glb")` in `Scene.load()`, then drive
`AnimationPlayer` beside its entity. `ctx.goto(name)` rebuilds without resetting game state; from
a frame function `goto` and then `return`; `ctx.state.set({ /* copy this game's initial-state shape */ })`
is a partial patch. `game.goto("<scene-name>")` also rebuilds the scene, but it resets the game's
state. Seeded randomness is deterministic only when `defineGame({ seed })` is configured.

`src/render/quality.ts` owns `low`, `medium`, `high`; `isMobile()` chooses `low`, otherwise `high`;
override with `setupPost(..., { tier: "low" })`. Unknown tiers throw and `TN_QUALITY_TIER` reports
the source. Keep state values human-readable; the bridge flushes about 100 ms and per-frame feel
stays in scene-owned Three.js.

When an animation looks wrong, measure it before rewriting it. `clipPoseError` scores a
retargeted clip against its source per bone in degrees — whole quaternions relative to each rig's
own bind pose, so the two rigs' bind conventions cancel and a limb rolled about its own axis is
caught where a bone-direction check reads zero. `clipTrackBindings` names tracks that bind nothing
(the `<bone>.undefined` failure that plays the bind pose instead of the animation),
`clipBoneCoverage` names bones the clip does not drive and which therefore keep the previous
clip's pose, and `boneContact` reports in metres whether a named bone reaches the prop it is
supposed to be touching.

## Budget real time for the look

Open a capture after visual changes. A scenario with no assertions or missing observations fails.
