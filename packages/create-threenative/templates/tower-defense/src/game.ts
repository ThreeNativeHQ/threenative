 *
 * Intents are one-way and named by the game: the UI sends `arm`, `launch`, `upgrade`, `recycle`,
 * `target`, `speed`, `pause`, `strike`, `restart` and the game decides what each means. Nothing
 * comes back this way — the UI reads the game's published state instead, which keeps one source
 * of truth on the side that owns the simulation. The listener only files the request; the scene
 * reads it inside its own frame, where changing the world is safe.
