// The sky photograph (`assets/sky.jpg`, Poly Haven's "Kloofendal 48d Partly Cloudy (Pure Sky)" by Greg
// Zaal and Jarod Guest, CC0) is the *environment* here, not the backdrop: it lights and reflects, and
// the diorama floats in a dark green void, so a photographed cloud never competes with the board.
// Swap the file for any equirectangular image, or delete the environment line for a fully lit-by-lamps look.
