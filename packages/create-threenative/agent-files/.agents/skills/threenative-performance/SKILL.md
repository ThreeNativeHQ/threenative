description: Measure ThreeNative frame budgets and report platform evidence without guessing. Use when a frame budget, FPS floor, or platform performance claim is in question, when reading `TN_FRAME_BUDGET`, or when writing a bounded performance assertion.

# ThreeNative performance evidence

Pool objects; load static GLBs through `ctx.assets.model()`; never claim Android/iOS from a
desktop proof. `TN_FRAME_BUDGET` reports `fps`, `hostGap`, `update`, `render`, `overlay`,
`residual` and per-pass draws and triangles. `defineGame({ frameBudget: false })` silences
output, never measurement.

## When the scene is the problem

`TN_SCENE_WARNING` fires when the GPU used under a third of a frame whose render phase overran
the display period: move draws and objects, not settings. `npx threenative doctor` and
`DEV_MODE=true` repeat it; `TN_FRAME_SPANS=1` splits that phase.
The largest static win is free — three skips per-object binding updates when nothing changed, so
not writing a transform saved 7.35 ms on 1,561 objects where `markStatic(root)` saved 0.009 ms.

## Use the shipped defaults

The engine prepares transforms, batches, culls, scales resolution and cooks assets;
read `node_modules/create-threenative/agent-docs/references/performance-basics.md` before hand-rolling any.
Unexecuted platforms stay unverified; never invent numbers.
Withdraw thermally-confounded Tiers 1–3 comparisons; always report Tier 4. Bounded proof:
`{"performance":{"maxFrameMsP95":33,"minFps":30,"maxPhaseMsP95":{"render":12},"maxPassDrawCalls":{"shadow":400}}}`,
defined in `node_modules/create-threenative/agent-docs/references/assertion-reference.md#performance`; pass bounds fail closed without a
per-pass split.

Android: budget a ~500 MiB driver floor before textures; a dual-use equirectangular
environment adds ~48 MiB: `node_modules/create-threenative/agent-docs/references/mobile-memory-budget.md`.

Name the hot function: `--cpu-prof <file>` (native, or a browser/desktop playtest) writes a
DevTools `.cpuprofile`.
