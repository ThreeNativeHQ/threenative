 * failure. The count is the claim, so it is a sentinel on the constructors and on `clone()` — a
 * path that copies its result instead of writing into a scratch vector is the exact defect this
 * catches, and the render modules already hold one `_dummy` and one `_ndc` for that reason.
 *
 * Vectors are not the whole story. `filter`, `map`, `slice` and friends each hand back a new
 * array, so a steady frame that calls one of them is allocating at sixty units — which is what a
 * `V2` sentinel alone would report as clean. Every array-producing call in the measured window is
 * counted too, across the simulation step, the render sync and the scene frame.

   *   it mints lives inside the dependency. Counting the calls is the only honest way to see it
   *   here, and a fixed frame must make zero of them after the cold first upload.
   *
   * The range is still there afterwards: one per attribute, the right count, the same record object
   * next frame, `version` still climbing, and the matrices still changing as the army walks. A fix
   * that dropped the range, or stopped writing, fails those.
