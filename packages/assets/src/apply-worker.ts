/**
 * The worker entry for the bounded compile pool. It runs the same pass chain a sequential bake
 * runs (`applyPasses`, extracted verbatim), rebuilt from the driver's serialisable specs, and
 * reports per-pass timings back so the cost instrument stays driver-owned across the boundary.
 *
 * The chain is built once per worker from the bootstrap message; each job afterwards carries
 * only the input. A shared-image store is created here against the job's output root, so an
 * encoded image a worker produced is written into the same content-addressed tree a sequential
 * build writes — the same bytes, by the determinism gate.
