/**
 * Card thinning — the foliage level reducer, for primitives a triangle simplifier must not touch
 * (PRD-458 §4, §5).
 *
 * A needle card is two triangles. A simplifier asked to cut its triangle count has two bad options
 * and no third: collapse a card (the alpha-tested silhouette is now the wrong shape) or drop a
 * triangle (a hole in the canopy). So the triangle reducer declines needle primitives, and the
 * earlier cook was therefore right to report `insufficient-reduction` for every tree. This reducer
 * works in the unit the geometry is actually authored in — the **card**, a connected component of
 * the index buffer — and spends it the way foliage is spent: by dropping whole cards, spread evenly
 * through the canopy, so the crown keeps its coverage while the triangle count falls.
 *
 * Two properties make the result worth shipping, and both are the reason this is not
 * `indices.filter((_, i) => i % 2 === 0)`:
 *
 * - **Stratified, not sampled.** Cards are bucketed into a deterministic 3D grid keyed by their
 *   centroid, and each occupied cell keeps at least one card at every level. Random thinning
 *   punches visible bald patches exactly where the cards were densest; index-order thinning keeps a
 *   contiguous block of the index buffer, which is one side of the tree. Grid buckets keep every
 *   region of the crown populated.
 * - **Deterministic.** Buckets are ordered by their integer cell key, cards within a bucket by a
 *   hash of their own centroid. The same input bytes always produce the same levels, which is what
 *   `determinism.spec.ts` and a cache keyed on a generation fingerprint both depend on.
 *
 * **Scaled, so the crown stays covered.** Each kept card is scaled about its centroid by
 * `sqrt(lod0Area / keptArea)`, so the survivors cover the area the dropped cards did. Un-scaled, a
 * level's card area falls to the keep ratio, and on Machinefall the mid-distance pines read as bare
 * trunks (PRD-539). `TN_discrete_lod` stays index-only: a level's scaled cards are *copies* appended
 * to the primitive's own vertex arrays (see {@link ICardCopies}), and the level's indices point at
 * them. LOD0's indices never reference a copy, so a stock loader draws LOD0 unchanged, and both
 * runtime readers already build a level by copying the base attributes and swapping the index buffer.
 */

/**
 * The largest component still treated as a card.
 *
 * A two-triangle quad is the common case and four-to-eight-triangle cards (a bent, a folded, a
 * low-poly cluster) are ordinary. Anything larger is a shell or a trunk fan, where dropping a
 * component would delete a silhouette, so the primitive is left to the triangle reducer.
