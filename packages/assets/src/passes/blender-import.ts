/**
 * Turns a `.fbx`, `.blend`, `.obj` or `.dae` into a GLB before `modelPass` sees it, so a file an
 * agent downloaded compiles on `pnpm build` with no agent present.
 *
 * Before this pass, `compileAssets` classified those four extensions as `"other"`, copied them
 * through untouched, and reported success — the build shipped a file no runtime can load and said
 * nothing. That passthrough is deleted for these extensions.
 *
 * With no Blender the pass **fails the compile** and names the install command. An `.fbx` in the
 * assets directory is an explicit request; copying it through silently is the bug being removed,
 * and a warning is the same bug with better manners.
 *
 * It calls the same bridge module the `blender_convert` MCP tool calls. Two conversion
 * implementations would be two sets of counts to reconcile.
