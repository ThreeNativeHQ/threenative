/**
 * Conditions a game's audio at build time and proves it did not destroy it.
 *
 * `AssetKind` has classified `.ogg`, `.wav` and `.mp3` as audio since the pipeline was written and
 * nothing acted on it: audio was classified and then shipped through untouched. A lane generated
 * nineteen clips for a game and conditioned them in a one-off script instead — downmix, cross-fade,
 * DC removal, peak, encode — and the script reported success on every one while having measured
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * What it actually got wrong was **content**, not joins: a chime that came back 92% low-mid with
 * nothing above 1 kHz, and footsteps carrying heavy sub-bass. The joins were fine — an early
 * reading that one bed was clicking came from comparing bare wrap steps between clips, and by the
 * measurement that reflects audibility that bed has the *cleaner* join of the two. That correction
 * is why the seam gate here judges a ratio and not a magnitude, and why the declared-band check
 * exists at all: the defect that shipped was the one nobody thought to measure.
 *
 * So this is `model.ts`'s shape rather than a filter chain: it transforms bytes and then measures
 * the result, and every measurement it takes is reported whether or not it was asked to assert on
 * it. Turning a convention off must not turn its measurement off — an undeclared clip's seam is
 * measured and lands in the receipt, it just does not fail the build.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - **Own the mix.** Peak handling defaults to a *ceiling*, which only ever attenuates. Normalising
 *   every clip up to the same peak would make a footstep as loud as a chime and force the game to
 *   undo the pipeline in its volume settings; that is deciding how the game sounds, and it belongs
 *   to the game. `normalise: "peak"` asks for the lift by name.
 * - **Guess intent.** See `audio-config.ts`.
 * - **Process at runtime.** Every measurement and every transform here happens once, at build time.
