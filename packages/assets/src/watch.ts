/**
 * Dev-mode compilation: watches the asset source directory and recompiles into the output
 * directory, so the dev loop is not "rebuild to see a texture".
 *
 * A settled burst runs `compileAssets` over the whole project — the same call the build lane
 * makes, once per burst rather than once per changed file. The compiler's cache is what makes
 * that affordable: an input whose bytes and pass configuration are unchanged is a hit and is
 * never re-encoded, so a save pays for the file that changed. It is also the only way the output
 * root stays honest, because nothing that matters here is per-file. One cook writes the manifest,
 * the receipt naming every file it owns, the shared images several models point at and the Basis
 * runtime the KTX2 loader fetches for them; it deletes the outputs the previous receipt owned and
 * this one does not; and it measures the byte budget across the project, which is the only scale
 * a ceiling means anything at. Cooking one file in isolation can produce a file but never a
 * project: it publishes an entry without the images underneath it, orphans yesterday's output in
 * `public/` the moment a save renames it, and clears a whole-game budget by weighing one asset.
 *
 * The price is that a burst fails closed. One compile means a broken file fails the burst, so a
 * good file saved beside it is not published either. That is the compiler's own contract — a pass
 * failure stops the build with the asset path — and the safe direction here: the last good cook
 * keeps serving, the named failure goes to stderr, and the next good save heals it.
 *
 * Watcher mechanism: `node:fs.watch({ recursive: true })` — deliberately neither chokidar nor
 * Vite's own server watcher. This package is Node-only with zero runtime dependencies; Vite's
 * watcher exists only inside a Vite process and would drag in a peer dependency, and chokidar
 * adds a package outright. Recursive `fs.watch` covers Windows, macOS and Linux on the Node
 * versions Vite already requires, keeps `watchAssets` usable outside a dev server, and leaves
 * the template plugin a handful of lines that only start and stop this watcher.
