 * and until now nothing acted on that: audio was classified and shipped through untouched. A lane
 * conditioned nineteen clips for a game in a one-off script instead, which reported success on all
 * nineteen while measuring none of them.
 *
 * The seam is the assertion these tests care about most, and the pair worth reading first is
 * "cross-fade did not take" against "step around the same jump": identical bytes, rejected when
 * the splice is pinned and accepted when it is free. It is measured on the decoded output bytes —
 * the ones that ship — because a cross-fade that is perfect in the intermediate PCM and ruined by
 * the encoder is still a click in the player's ears, and it is measured as a **ratio** to the steps
 * beside the join, because an absolute bound condemns dense clips and excuses quiet ones.
