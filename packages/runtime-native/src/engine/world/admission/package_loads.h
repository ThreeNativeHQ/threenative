 * and calls `done` once every entry is resident (or once the load fails).
 *
 * `cancel` is safe at any point: `done` never runs for a cancelled load, and entries it already
 * uploaded are destroyed through GpuResources, whose GPU objects live on until every submission
 * that may use them has completed. Destroying the world's queue first is safe too: a worker's
 * completion is refused, so nothing of that world runs afterwards.
