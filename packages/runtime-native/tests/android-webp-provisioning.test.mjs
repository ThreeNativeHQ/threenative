/**
 * WebP must be provisionable for every platform a game can ship textures to.
 *
 * This is the drift guard for a failure that reached a physical Pixel 8 twice: a
 * GLB carrying EXT_texture_webp textures loads every mesh but drops every
 * texture, because the Android runtime was built without libwebp. The symptom is
 * untextured white models plus one logcat line — nothing fails at build time.
 *
 * Three files must stay in sync or the white-models failure returns:
 *   1. scripts/download-deps.mjs  — provisions the libwebp source for Android.
 *   2. CMakeLists.txt             — builds it into the runtime under ANDROID.
 *   3. scripts/asset-preflight.mjs — fails closed while the capability is absent.
 * Each test names which leg of that triangle it pins.
