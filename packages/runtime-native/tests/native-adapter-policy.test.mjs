// The public software-adapter fact, executed on the real native host, driving the template's own
// quality policy.
//
// Three earlier proofs each cover one link and none covers the path a game takes: the forced
// SwiftShader browser run proves the policy answers `low` on a CPU rasteriser, and the desktop STUB
// unit feeds a synthetic adapter to the classifier. `createRenderer` is internal to core, so the
// public way to reach the fact is what a game does: `game.start()`, then `ctx.renderer.softwareAdapter`,
// then the template's `resolveQualityTier`. This runs that on the built host — bundle, launch,
// observe — and classifies the adapter identity from a separate `requestAdapter()` read.
//
// What it does and does not claim: it proves the fact is produced and the policy consumes it on
// THIS host. A hardware host reports `softwareAdapter: null` and the high tier, which says nothing
// about a software adapter natively — that half is proven by the browser SwiftShader run. The
// assertions are written as the relationship rather than the value, so they hold for either class.
