// Does the host give three.js a cooperative yield, instead of a whole rendered frame?
//
// `three`'s `yieldToMain()` (src/utils.js) is:
//
//     if ( typeof self !== 'undefined' && typeof self.scheduler !== 'undefined'
//          && typeof self.scheduler.yield !== 'undefined' ) return self.scheduler.yield();
//     return new Promise( resolve => { requestAnimationFrame( resolve ); } );
//
// `NodeBuilder.buildAsync()` awaits that once per node, and the render path's deferred build queue
// (`NodeManager.getForRenderDeferred` -> `_processBuildQueue` -> `getForRenderAsync`) goes through
// the same call. This runtime shimmed `self` years ago and never shimmed `scheduler`, so the probe
// always failed and every async node build cost **one fully rendered frame** — 50 ms and up during
// play on a Pixel 8, paid per node, which is what a player feels when a new material first appears.
//
// These assertions execute the installer exactly as the runtime ships it: the script is read from
// `src/runtime-scripts/scheduler-yield.js` rather than retyped, so a test cannot pass against a
// copy that has drifted from the source. That is the whole point — a hand-copied snippet would
// keep passing after someone edited the real one. PRD-207 moved every shim out of `runtime.cpp`
// raw-string literals into that directory, so the bootstrap is asserted separately below.
