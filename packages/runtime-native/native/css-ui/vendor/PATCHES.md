# Vendored patches

Five upstream crates are vendored here and wired with `[patch.crates-io]` in this crate's
`Cargo.toml`. Each is a pinned version copied from the crates.io registry source unchanged apart
from the hunks below; `LICENSE-MIT` / `LICENSE-APACHE` are the upstream licences, which the
published `.crate` archives omit.

A crate is vendored only where the defect is inside a dependency this crate does not own and no
public API of it reaches the behaviour: four of taffy's percentage-padding call sites resolve the
block axis against the container's height, and fontique resolves a family name through a map of
*installed* families, so a document naming `Arial` gets nothing at all. Both are reachable only by
carrying the crate.

Every hunk is here because a measurement proves the behaviour it fixes — almost always a fixture in
the browser oracle in `examples/native-css-hud/corpus`, which each hunk names — and each is kept to
a single property so that dropping a patch is a one-line change in `Cargo.toml`. The exception is
the one the browser cannot see, blitz-dom hunk 4, a retained record that only shows up in
`bench mount`'s resident set and in the crate's own release build.

Run `cd examples/native-css-hud && node corpus/oracle.mjs` for the measurements quoted below, and
`node corpus/interaction.mjs` for the interaction scenarios (hunks 8-12), which is the oracle an
interaction hunk is proved against.

Each crate heading counts added lines against the crates.io source of the same version, comments,
blank lines and the licence files excluded:
`diff -ru -x Cargo.lock -x .cargo-ok -x 'LICENSE*' ~/.cargo/registry/src/*/<crate> vendor/<crate>`,
counting the `+` lines that are neither blank nor a comment.

Four hunks are over the ~80-line guideline: parley hunk 1 below, blitz-dom hunk 11, and the two
halves of the inline box decoration (blitz-dom hunk 14, blitz-paint hunk 3). Hunk 11 is
the hit-test clip, and the overage is the rounded-rectangle test (~20 of those lines): a
`border-radius` may round a corner to an ellipse, so one point needs both radii to be answered, and
answering it in the shared walk is what keeps a click in a clipped-away corner from being one hit
per ancestor. The separable part is the `clip` argument on `hit_inner`; dropping it leaves the
radius half working for the element's own box only. Parley hunk 1 is ~130 lines, 49 of them
`strut_metrics` — a strut needs its own font query, which the shaper's does not expose — and 24 the
shared `leading_box` helper that replaced two copies of the same half-leading arithmetic; four
fixtures now depend on it (`box-model-and-sizing`, `inline-runs`, `text-line-height-normal`,
`dpr-2-layout-and-paint`), and its three separable parts each fail one of them on their own.
Blitz-dom hunk 14 is ~164 lines, of which ~50 are `Node::inline_decoration` (twelve sides resolved
from Stylo, because a span is never a Taffy node and so has no Taffy style to read) and ~35 are the
old `inline_fragment_rects` loop moved into `inline_fragments` so paint can share it; blitz-paint
hunk 3 is ~94, almost all of it `draw_inline_decorations`, and deletes the 40-line
`draw_inline_backgrounds` it replaces.

## `blitz-paint-0.3.0-beta.2` — 125 added code lines

### 1. `outline-offset` was ignored: the outline was drawn inside the border box

* **Where:** `src/kurbo_css/css_box.rs` (`CssBox::new`, `CssBox::outline`, `CssBox::corner`,
  `CssBox::is_sharp`, `CssBox::ellipse`), `src/kurbo_css/mod.rs` (a new
  `CssBoxKind::OutlineInnerBox`), `src/render.rs` (`create_css_rect` reads
  `style.get_outline().outline_offset`).
* **Why:** the outline ring ran from `border_box.inset(outline_width)` (kurbo's `inset` grows for a
  positive amount) to the border box, so `outline-offset: 3px` left the ring touching the box. CSS
  UI 4 §4.2 puts the ring `outline-offset` away from the border edge and `outline-width` thick
  outwards from there. The inner edge is a new box kind because the ring can no longer start at the
  border box, and its corner radii grow by the offset.
* **Proves it:** `paint-radius-border-shadow` — the white outline now sits 3px off the blue box
  (SSIM 0.9425 → 0.9996, fixture passes). `outline-offset` 0, 3 and 6 on a bare 100×60 box are each
  pixel-identical to Chromium.

### 2. an inline layout's cut line was not the line that got painted

* **Where:** `src/render.rs` (`draw_inline_layout`: one `painted` binding, and the three text passes
  that read it).
* **Why:** `text-overflow: ellipsis` is laid out as its own inline layout alongside the whole line
  (blitz-dom hunk 7), and paint drew the whole line — the ellipsis was laid out and thrown away.
  Nothing else in this crate reads it: the element's box, hit testing and selection all still use
  the uncut line, which is what keeps a resize honest.
* **Proves it:** `text-ellipsis` — SSIM 0.9603 → 0.9947, fixture passes on the strict 0.99 bar.

### 3. a non-atomic inline painted a text-width background and no border at all

* **Where:** `src/render.rs` (the new `ElementCx::draw_inline_decorations`, called from
  `draw_inline_layout`), `src/text.rs` (`draw_inline_backgrounds` deleted).
* **Why:** an inline element's background was one rectangle per glyph run, the run's own font box
  and nothing else: no padding, no border, no `border-radius`, and an inline nested in another left
  a hole in its parent's background. Each inline element in the layout is now painted per line
  fragment (blitz-dom hunk 14's `inline_fragments`) through the same `ElementCx` a block box uses —
  `create_css_rect`, `draw_background`, `draw_border` — on a `taffy::Layout` built for the fragment.
  The sides are `box-decoration-break: slice`, Chromium's default: only the first fragment carries
  the start side's border, padding and corner radii, only the last the end side's (swapped for
  `direction: rtl`). Outermost elements paint first. An element with no background and no border
  costs one style read. Box shadows and outlines of inlines are still not painted.
* **Proves it:** `inline-margins` (SSIM 0.9532 → 0.9964), `inline-borders-radius` (0.9892: a
  different colour per border side and a pill radius) and `inline-margins-wrap` (0.9806: a rounded,
  bordered span sliced across two lines), plus
  `tests/inline_box.rs::an_inline_paints_its_border_and_its_padding_box`, which fails against the
  previous vendor sources.

## `blitz-dom-0.3.0-beta.2` — 493 added code lines

### 1. hoisted (`z-index`) children were painted one frame late, at the wrong offset

* **Where:** `src/layout/damage.rs` (`flush_styles_to_layout_impl`, plus the new
  `resolve_hoisted_paint_positions{,_impl}`), `src/resolve.rs` (one call after `resolve_layout`).
* **Why:** `flush_styles_to_layout` runs *before* layout and folded each node's
  `final_layout().location` into the hoisted children's paint offsets while the tree was being
  built. Those locations are the previous frame's, and all zero on the first frame, so a
  `position: absolute; z-index: 1` box was painted at its containing block's origin instead of
  where it laid out — the cyan square in `positioning` was 10px (the margined parent's offset) off.
  The same staleness fed `HoistedPaintChildren::content_area`, which hit testing reads, so that is
  recomputed here too.
* **Proves it:** `positioning` — SSIM 0.9603 → 1.0, fixture passes. Every box in it already matched
  within 1px, which is what made this a paint-only bug.

### 2. a non-atomic inline's box was its line box instead of its font box

* **Where:** `src/document.rs` (`inline_fragment_rects`).
* **Why:** the fragment rect of an inline element used the line box's block extent (the
  leading-included extent text selection highlights use), so `getClientRects()` reported every
  inline as tall as its line. Browsers report the font box: the run's ascent and descent either
  side of the line's baseline.
* **Proves it:** `ua-defaults` — five inline elements (`a`, `strong`, `em`, `b`, `i`) go from
  1.06px tall on the bottom edge to within 1px, and the fixture passes.

### 3. an atomic inline had no baseline of its own

* **Where:** `src/layout/inline.rs` (the inline-box sizing loop), `src/layout/construct.rs` (two
  `InlineBox` literals).
* **Why:** `parley::InlineBox` had no baseline, so parley aligned every atomic inline by its bottom
  margin edge. That is only right for a box with no in-flow line boxes (CSS 2.1 §10.8.1); an
  `inline-block` or `inline-flex` with text aligns on its content's baseline. Without this, patch 1
  below makes every line holding a button 6px too tall — visible as a regression in this crate's own
  Chrome-derived reference frame. The sizing loop therefore asks for a *perform-layout* pass (the
  child's baseline is not reported by a measure-only pass) and stores it, measured from the margin
  box top like the box's height.
* **Proves it:** `cargo test --release` (34 tests, including `matches_the_chrome_reference_frame`,
  which compares against a frame Chrome produced) plus the `positioning` and `box-model-and-sizing`
  fixtures.

### 4. every node ever created was recorded, and freed

* **Where:** `src/document.rs` (`remove_node_from_tree`, plus the new `BaseDocument::node_count`).
* **Why:** `create_node` records each new node in `changed_nodes` for the accessibility tree, and
  nothing ever drained that record: the only reader is `has_changes()`, which no caller has and
  whose sense is inverted. So the set grew by one entry per node the document had ever built, for
  as long as it lived. A HUD mounts and disposes panels, so this is the normal path, not an edge
  one: `bench mount` reported 58 → 77 → 114 MB of resident set over 3,200 build-then-remove cycles
  of a 1,000-element HUD, and a `HashSet<NodeId>` of 6.08M entries accounts for the climb. The set
  describes the nodes that changed *and are still live*, so freeing the node frees its record, and
  `remove_node_from_tree` is the one place every removal (a dropped subtree, a deallocated anonymous
  block) funnels through.
* **Proves it:** `cargo test --release` —
  `mounting_and_disposing_repeatedly_releases_every_node` runs 600 mount/dispose cycles and fails
  on the released heap (4.7 MB retained, against a 256 KB budget for a neighbouring test's frame
  buffer). `bench mount` over 3,200 cycles of a 1,000-element HUD now reports 33 → 36 → 33 → 33 MB
  at the quarters where it used to report 58 → 77 → 114 → 114, and `bench resheet` 30 → 37 → 30 →
  30 MB against 58 → 77 → 114 → 114: flat inside allocator noise, where it climbed before.

### 5. `<button>`'s user-agent sheet claimed a centring Chromium does not do

* **Where:** `assets/default.css` (the `button` / `input[type=…]` rule).
* **Why:** the sheet is Gecko's, and Gecko emulates the button box with `display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center; justify-content: center`. Chromium's own sheet is `display: inline-block;
  text-align: center; align-items: flex-start` — it centres the content in its *own* box rather than
  as a flex item. The two agree for a button with no author `display`, and disagree for an author
  `display: flex`: with Gecko's values the label is centred, with Chromium's it is flush to the
  content box's top-start, which is what a fixed-height `display: flex` button looks like there.
* **Proves it:** `button-centring` — the author-`display: flex` button's label lands where
  Chromium's does, and the inline-block button's is centred (SSIM 0.9968, fixture passes). Dropping
  the alignment hunk below puts that label 5px high and the fixture at 0.9769.

### 6. a `<button>`'s content was top-aligned in its content box

* **Where:** `src/layout/inline.rs` (the new centre-the-content step after the line boxes are
  aligned, and its `shift_lines` call), with `Layout::shift_lines` in the parley hunk below.
* **Why:** a button's box is not its content box — Blink's `LayoutNGButton` and Gecko's
  `-moz-button-content` both centre the content in it — so a fixed-height button's label sat
  ~5px high in every fixed-height button this crate laid out. Only a flow-rooted inside display is
  that button box: `display: flex`/`grid` is the author's own layout, where the user-agent sheet's
  `align-items` governs instead (hunk 5), so the two halves are kept apart. The content's own
  height is the only height known where this can be applied, so what it centres is the line boxes:
  a button whose content is a block box stays top-aligned, which is the one case this hunk does not
  cover and no fixture measures.
* **Proves it:** `state-selectors-and-environment` — its three `display: block` buttons' labels move
  from 5px high to centred (SSIM 0.9650 → 0.9952, fixture passes), and `button-centring` covers
  `inline-block` and `flex` in the same frame. `cargo test --release` (35 tests, including
  `matches_the_chrome_reference_frame`) plus every other fixture stay green.

### 7. `text-overflow: ellipsis` painted nothing

* **Where:** `src/layout/inline.rs` (the new `ellipsize_inline_layout`, called once the line boxes
  are aligned), `src/node/text.rs` (`TextLayout::ellipsized`), with the paint half in blitz-paint
  below.
* **Why:** neither Stylo nor parley nor blitz implements `text-overflow`, so an overflowing
  `white-space: nowrap` line was simply clipped at the content box, and Chromium's U+2026 was
  missing from the frame. Cutting the line is not something a shaped layout can do: a `nowrap` line
  is never broken, so narrowing the break advance moves nothing, and parley cannot drop trailing
  clusters. So the prefix that still fits — the last whole cluster whose advance, plus the
  ellipsis's own, stays inside the content box — is re-shaped with a U+2026 appended and kept as
  `TextLayout::ellipsized`. It is a second layout rather than a replacement on purpose: `layout`
  still holds every cluster of the line, so the element's own box is measured from the uncut text
  and a wider content box breaks the whole line again instead of staying stuck short. Only the
  single-line case is modelled (`text-overflow: <string>` and a multi-line ellipsis are not), the
  cut is by logical cluster so a right-to-left line is cut at its start, and the ellipsis takes the
  inline root's font rather than the run's.
* **Proves it:** `text-ellipsis` — SSIM 0.9603 → 0.9947, fixture passes on the strict 0.99 bar, and
  `text-overflow-fits` proves the other half, that a line which fits comes out exactly as it would
  with no `text-overflow` at all (forcing the ellipsis on a fitting line drops it to 0.9786).

### 8. `:focus-visible` never matched, and a pointer focus could not be told from a keyboard one

* **Where:** `src/stylo.rs` (`NonTSPseudoClass::FocusVisible`), `src/document.rs` (the new
  `set_focus_visible`, with `set_focus_to` delegating to it), `src/node/node.rs` (`Node::focus`
  takes the focus-visible flag).
* **Why:** `:focus-visible` was hard-coded to `false`, so a control focused by Tab looked the
  same as one never focused — a keyboard HUD gave no feedback at all. Matching it needs a state bit
  to read, and `ElementState::FOCUSRING` was already set on *every* focus, so there was no way to
  keep a pointer focus (a click on a button) from raising the ring. `focus_visible` is the flag
  that separates them, and it is a per-call argument rather than a document setting because the
  caller is the only one that knows which kind of focus caused the change.
* **Proves it:** `focus-traversal-and-activation` — the pixel after two Tabs is `#f59e0b`, the
  `:focus-visible` colour, and the pixel after a mouse click on the same button is its own
  `#334155`; `tests/interaction.rs::a_pointer_focus_is_not_a_focus_visible_one`. Reverting the
  `stylo.rs` line alone fails the scenario and the test.

### 9. the device could not say it was driven by touch

* **Where:** `src/document.rs` (`make_device` takes a `touch` flag, the new `set_touch`, and the
  `touch` field), `src/mutator.rs` (one argument at the `ViewportMut` drop).
* **Why:** `make_device` passed `PointerCapabilities::default()`, which is a mouse with hover on
  every non-mobile target, so `@media (hover: hover)` and `(pointer: coarse)` could not be
  answered at all. A touch-only device is `(hover: none) (pointer: coarse)`, which is what makes
  Tailwind's `@media (hover:hover){.hover\:bg-…:hover{…}}` — the wrapper Tailwind puts around
  every `hover:` class — not apply on a phone. The flag is a plain `bool` rather than the stylo
  `PointerCapabilities` bitflags so that no caller has to name a stylo type to reach it.
* **Proves it:** `touch-hover-and-environment` (a tap leaves `.h` its own colour under
  `(hover:hover)`, and `tests/interaction.rs::a_mouse_hovers_and_a_finger_does_not`), plus
  `a_tap_leaves_no_hover_behind`.

### 10. a wheel delta that a scroller could not fully take was handed to its parent

* **Where:** `src/scrolling.rs` (the new `scroll_wheel`).
* **Why:** `scroll_chain_by` transfers whatever the first scroller could not consume to its parent
  within the same event, which is right for a fling and wrong for a wheel tick: a browser latches
  the tick to one scroller. Over a list that could take 90px of a 300px tick, the browser scrolled
  the list by 90 and stopped, while this scrolled the list by 90 and the page by 210. It also
  walked the whole ancestor chain for a *programmatic* scroll, which is not a user scroll at all.
  `scroll_wheel` takes the nearest scroller that can move in the requested direction — one with
  room left takes the whole delta and keeps the rest, one at its limit passes the event on — and
  never reaches the viewport, because this document has no page to scroll.
* **Proves it:** `nested-scroll` — three wheels of 50, 300 and 300px land at `[0,50]`, `[0,140]`
  (outer still 0) and `[0,300]`, and `tests/interaction.rs`'s three wheel tests.

### 11. hit testing ignored the overflow clip, the border radius, and `pointer-events` on the element itself

* **Where:** `src/node/node.rs` (the new `Clip` and `Node::clip_shape`, and `hit_inner` taking the
  ancestor clip and testing it), `src/document.rs` (`hit_with_scrollbar` passes `None`).
* **Why:** `hit_inner` descended into children whose box lay outside a clipping ancestor, so a
  click in the clipped-away part of a scroll panel hit the content that was not painted there: an
  `overflow: hidden` HUD card with a tall list inside it would swallow clicks meant for the game
  behind it. It also compared points against each element's plain rectangle, so the corner a
  `border-radius` rounds away was still a hit, and the clip an ancestor establishes was never
  intersected with a child's. `clip_shape` is the one place that knows both halves — the padding
  box when the node clips its overflow, the border-radius curve always, since a rounded corner is
  not painted — and the clip is threaded down the same walk, in the coordinate space each level is
  already tested in, so transforms need no special case. `pointer-events: none` was already
  honoured (hunk-free); the element's own rounded box was not.
* **Proves it:** `clipped-hit-test` (four clicks: inside the clip, outside it, in the rounded
  corner, in the circle) and `transform-hit-test-and-pointer-events`, plus five tests in
  `tests/interaction.rs`. Dropping the clip test, the radius test, or the inverse transform fails
  one of them each.

### 12. `<button disabled>` was focusable, because an empty attribute value does not parse as `false`

* **Where:** `src/node/element.rs` (`flush_is_focussable`).
* **Why:** `attr_parsed::<bool>("disabled")` on `<button disabled>` — the attribute HTML writes
  with no value — returns `None`, and `unwrap_or(false)` read that as "not disabled". So a
  disabled button was in the tab order, and `focus-traversal-and-activation` stopped on it. What
  disables a control is the attribute's presence, which the sibling `ElementState::DISABLED` code
  already used (`has_attr`).
* **Proves it:** `focus-traversal-and-activation` — Tab visits 1, 3, 4 and 6 and never the disabled
  2 — and `tests/interaction.rs::tab_stops_at_focusable_elements_in_document_order`.

### 13. `line-height: normal` was 1.2 of the font size

* **Where:** `src/stylo_to_parley.rs` (`style`: `stylo::LineHeight::Normal` now maps to
  `parley::LineHeight::MetricsRelative(1.0)`).
* **Why:** `normal` is the used font's own line height — its ascent, descent and line gap — and not
  an approximation in ems. `FontSizeRelative(1.2)` is right for a font whose metrics happen to be
  1.2 em and wrong for every other face: Noto Sans is 1.362 em and Noto Sans Arabic 2.112 em, so a
  `normal` line came out shorter than its own text at one size and taller at another, and a fallback
  face's metrics never reached the line box at all. `MetricsRelative` is parley's own variant for
  exactly this, and parley hunk 1 below is what makes it resolve to Chromium's number.
* **Proves it:** `text-line-height-normal` — the mixed-script paragraph is Chromium's 34px and the
  Latin-only one 22px (SSIM 0.5536 with `FontSizeRelative(1.2)`), and `ua-defaults`' bare `<button>`
  is its 21px, which is what the UA sheet's `line-height: normal` is for.

### 14. a non-atomic inline's horizontal margin, border and padding took no space in the line

* **Where:** `src/layout/construct.rs` (the non-replaced `(Inline, Flow)` branch pushes an edge box
  either side of the span's content; `edge: None` on the two existing `InlineBox` literals),
  `src/layout/inline.rs` (the inline-box sizing loop sizes an
  edge from the element's decoration instead of laying out a node; the placement loop skips it),
  `src/node/node.rs` (the new `InlineDecoration` and `Node::inline_decoration`), `src/document.rs`
  (`inline_fragment_rects` now delegates to the new `inline_fragments`, which paint shares).
* **Why:** a `<span>` is a style span in its inline root's parley layout, and parley has no inline
  start/end spacing, so `a<span style="margin:0 20px">b</span>c` and `padding: 0 12px` both laid out
  as `abc` with nothing between — every Tailwind badge (`px-2 rounded bg-…` on a span) came out
  text-tight. Each span whose start or end side has a non-zero margin + border + padding now gets a
  zero-height `parley::InlineBox` at that edge (`edge: Some(Start | End)`, parley hunk 4), whose
  width is that sum, resolved in `inline.rs` with percentages against the inline root's content
  width (the containing block; 0 while that width is indefinite, i.e. during intrinsic sizing).
  `direction: rtl` puts the start edge's sum on the right side. `inline_fragments` is the old
  per-line union, with the element's own edges counted minus their margin, its vertical padding and
  border added around the font box (which paints without moving the line, as in a browser), the
  whitespace a line ends with excluded (it hangs outside every box), and the run's ascent and
  descent rounded at the CSS font size as Chromium rounds them — so `getClientRects()`/`node_box`
  is the border box, margin excluded.
* **Proves it:** `inline-margins` — 2 edge misses → 0, SSIM 0.9532 → 0.9964, fixture passes;
  `inline-borders-radius` and `inline-margins-wrap` (0 edge misses each). Unrounded ascent/descent
  puts the wrapped fragment's bottom border a device pixel low (`inline-margins-wrap` 0.9806 →
  0.9765), and counting the hanging space draws the first fragment 3px too wide (→ 0.9794).
  `tests/inline_box.rs::an_inline_reserves_its_margin_border_and_padding_in_the_line` fails against
  the previous vendor sources. Known limits: a click on a span's padding hits the inline root rather
  than the span (parley's cluster hit test skips inline boxes), and RTL is implemented but no
  fixture measures it.

## `parley-0.11.1` — 240 added code lines

Hunk 1 is the one over the guideline and it is separable in three pieces, each of which a fixture
fails on its own: the strut (`box-model-and-sizing`), the order and scale of the quantisation
(`inline-runs`, `dpr-2-layout-and-paint`) and the metrics-relative line height
(`text-line-height-normal`). Hunk 2 is 10 lines, hunk 3 ~40 and hunk 4 ~57, each on its own.

### 1. line boxes had no strut, and the half-leading was quantised in the wrong order and at the wrong scale

* **Where:** `src/layout/line_break.rs` (`finish_line`, `start_new_line`),
  `src/layout/data.rs` (`LayoutData::strut_ascent`/`strut_descent`, and the metrics-relative line
  height in `push_run`), `src/layout/line.rs` (the new `leading_box`, and `InlineBox` placement in
  `line.rs`'s item iterator), `src/layout/mod.rs` (`leading_box` is now crate-visible),
  `src/inline_box.rs` (the new `InlineBox::baseline`), `src/builder.rs` (`strut_metrics`, called
  from `build_into_layout`), `src/resolve/tree.rs` (`begin` now puts the root style at style-table
  index 0).
* **Why:** parley computed a line's height as the largest `line-height` on it and then split the
  remaining leading once for the whole line. CSS 2.1 §10.8.1 is per inline box: each one's
  half-leading sits around *its* baseline, and every line also carries a strut built from the block
  container's own font and line-height. So a line holding only atomic inlines lost the strut's
  descent (a 100×60 line of two `inline-block`s came out 36px instead of 42px), and a line mixing a
  16px and a 12px run came out 24px instead of 25.35px. `strut_metrics` measures the strut through
  the same font query the shaper uses, so it is the same face at the same scale; with no resolvable
  font it is `(0, 0)` and line boxes stay as tall as their content. The root style is now always
  style-table entry 0, because a layout with no text never commits a span and the strut is measured
  before line breaking.

  Three details of Chromium's arithmetic are what `leading_box` now follows, and each one was
  measured against it rather than inferred. **Rounding order:** Chromium rounds the ascent and
  descent before it splits the leading and gives the larger half below (`NGLineHeightMetrics`, and
  the comment this crate already carried in its own line-level metrics). That order is what a run
  smaller than the block's own font turns on: at 12px in a `line-height: 24px` line the leading box
  is 16 above and 8 below, where rounding each side once it has its share of an *unrounded* split
  gives 17 and 7 — and a line holding both a 16px and a 12px run then comes out 25px where Chromium
  has 26. **Scale:** a browser's font metrics and line boxes come out the same number of CSS px at
  every device scale factor, so the rounding and the split happen at the CSS font size and the
  result is scaled; quantizing in device pixels moves a line by half a CSS px as soon as the scale
  is not 1, which at dpr 2 is a whole device pixel of the baseline. **A metrics-relative line
  height** is the font's own, so it is built from those same rounded numbers: 16px Noto Sans is
  17 + 5 = 22 and not the 21.792 skrifa reports, and the 0.208 that rounding takes away would
  otherwise come back as negative leading whose floored half lands a pixel above the baseline of
  every `line-height: normal` line.
* **Proves it:** `box-model-and-sizing` — the `div` holding two inline-blocks is 42px, matching
  Chromium (fixture passes, SSIM 1.0), and `inline-runs`' paragraph is 50px. `inline-runs` is also
  what fails if the split rounds after the leading is divided rather than before: 0.9882 → 0.9446,
  with its second line a pixel low. `dpr-2-layout-and-paint` fails if the quantisation happens in
  device pixels: 0.9939 → 0.9836, the 18px `h3`'s baseline half a CSS px low. `text-line-height-normal`
  fails if the metrics-relative height is left unrounded: 0.9906 → 0.9068, every glyph a pixel high.

### 2. a line box could not be moved along the block axis

* **Where:** `src/layout/layout.rs` (the new `Layout::shift_lines`).
* **Why:** a container whose content box is taller than its content aligns that content rather than
  growing to fill the box — a `<button>` centres its label (blitz-dom hunk 6). The line boxes are
  where the content's geometry lives, so moving them there reaches every consumer at once (painting,
  hit testing, `getClientRects()`) instead of an offset each of them would have to add and forget.
  The layout's own `height()` is left alone: it is the extent of the content, not of the box.
* **Proves it:** `button-centring` and `state-selectors-and-environment` (0.9769 and 0.9650 without
  it, both fixtures fail).

### 3. a fallback run stretched the line it borrowed glyphs for

* **Where:** `src/shape/mod.rs` (`FontSelector` remembers the first font the style's family list
  resolves to, and `shape_item` hands it to `push_run`), `src/layout/data.rs` (`push_run` takes the
  inline box's own font and derives `box_ascent`/`box_descent` from it when the run's face is a
  fallback), `src/layout/run.rs` (the two new `RunMetrics` fields), `src/layout/line_break.rs`
  (`finish_line` reads them).
* **Why:** the half-leading of a specified `line-height` belongs to the *inline box*, and an inline
  box's font is the first one its family list resolved to — not a fallback that merely supplied
  glyphs that font lacks. Without this, a paragraph that fixed `line-height: 24px` and mixed in
  Arabic from a fallback face 2.1 em tall grew its line boxes to 25px, because that run's own
  leading box (17 above, 7 below) outgrew the strut's (18 above, 6 below) on the block axis. A
  `line-height: normal` line is the exception and is left alone: there the run's own metrics *are*
  what set the line height, so they still apply — which is why the same fallback face takes
  `text-line-height-normal`'s first paragraph from 22px to Chromium's 34px.
* **Proves it:** `text-mixed-direction` — its three 24px lines are Chromium's 24px again (SSIM
  0.9847; 0.839 with two edge misses when `finish_line` reads `ascent`/`descent` instead of
  `box_ascent`/`box_descent`). `text-line-height-normal` is the other half and stays green either
  way, which is what makes the exception in this hunk a measured one rather than an assumption.

### 4. an inline element's edges had no way into a line

* **Where:** `src/inline_box.rs` (`InlineBox::edge` and the new `InlineBoxEdge`, re-exported from
  `src/lib.rs`), `src/layout/line.rs` (`PositionedInlineBox::edge`), `src/builder.rs`
  (`TreeBuilder::push_inline_edge`), `src/layout/line_break.rs` (`start_edge_boundary`, and no
  break opportunity after an edge), `src/layout/data.rs` (`calculate_content_widths`).
* **Why:** blitz-dom hunk 14 reserves a span's margin, border and padding as inline boxes, and an
  ordinary inline box is wrong three ways for that. It is a break opportunity after itself, so a
  span wrapping at its first word left its start edge — padding and border — stranded at the end of
  the line above; a browser breaks *before* the edge, because the break opportunity belongs to the
  text and the edge travels with the content it opens. So a text break that lands right after one
  or more start edges is taken before them (`start_edge_boundary`), and no edge marks a break of its
  own; an end edge that overflows takes the last break before the content it closes. It also resets
  white-space collapsing, so `a <span> b</span>` would keep both spaces; `push_inline_edge` leaves
  that state alone (an end edge commits the span's text as its last, as popping it would). And it
  splits the min-content width, where an edge now joins the word it opens or closes.
* **Proves it:** `inline-margins-wrap`'s second paragraph wraps at the span's first word: with the
  start-edge boundary disabled it is 1 edge miss and SSIM 0.9202 (0.9806 with it, fixture passes).

## `taffy-0.14.0` — 4 added code lines

### 1. four of twenty-eight call sites resolved a percentage padding against the container's *height*

* **Where:** `src/compute/block.rs:806` (the aspect-ratio block container's padding and border) and
  `src/compute/flexbox.rs:2061` (the same pair in the `max-width` aspect-ratio transfer).
* **Why:** CSS 2.1 §8.3 resolves a percentage `padding`/`border-width` against the containing
  block's width on all four sides. taffy resolves a `Rect` against a `Size`, so a caller that passes
  the whole size hands the block axis the container's height: in a 400×340 block,
  `padding-top: 5%` came out 17px instead of 20px, and every percentage `border-width` with it.
  Twenty-four of the crate's own padding and border call sites already pass
  `node_inner_size.width`; these four were the only ones passing the size, and matching them is the
  whole fix.
* **Proves it:** `intrinsic-sizing-and-margins` — the `.pp` rule (`width: 50%; padding: 5% 0 0;
  height: 20px`) is 20px of top padding and every box below it lands where Chromium's does
  (5 edge misses and SSIM 0.9954 → 0.9607 with the registry's four lines restored).

## `fontique-0.11.1` — 37 added code lines

### 1. a family name no installed font carries resolved to nothing at all

* **Where:** `src/collection/mod.rs` (`Collection::family_id` asks the system backend once the
  registered fonts have answered), `src/backend/fontconfig.rs` (`SystemFonts::family_id`,
  `substituted_family`, and the `substituted` cache that holds the answer).
* **Why:** the family map fontique builds is the *installed* fonts' own names, so a document that
  names a family the machine has never heard of — `Arial`, `Helvetica`, anything in a design system's
  stack — matched nothing: no font, no metrics, and a silent fall through to whatever the query's
  script fallback happened to offer. fontconfig is what decides what stands in for such a name
  (`fc-match Arial` is Liberation Sans here), and Chromium on this platform asks fontconfig the same
  question, so this asks it too and takes the identifier of the family it substituted. The answer is
  cached, negative results included: a stylesheet names every family in its stack on every element it
  matches, and an uncached `FcFontMatch` per name per element turns laying out a thousand nodes into
  seconds of FFI round-trips.
* **Proves it:** `ua-defaults` — its bare `<button>` takes the UA sheet's `font: 400 13.3333px
  Arial`, and with this hunk its 21px line box is the one Chromium measures on Liberation Sans;
  without it the button is 3.09px tall at the bottom and the column above it with it (2 edge misses).
