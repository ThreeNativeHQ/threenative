//! The Linux UI layer: a web view rendered offscreen, handed to the game as a texture.
//!
//! This replaces an X11 override-redirect top-level window blended by whatever compositing manager
//! happened to be running. Two defects came from that design and both are structural, not bugs:
//! nothing painted at all on a KDE Wayland session (the overlay window was mapped and empty), and
//! the web view was serviced only from the game loop, so it got about three turns in the thirty-eight
//! seconds a measured launch spent loading and its page finished mounting after the game had already
//! hidden its loading screen. See PRD-393.
//!
//! What is here instead:
//!
//! - **No window.** `GtkOffscreenWindow` plus a `WebKitWebView`, so nothing is mapped, nothing is
//!   blended by an external compositor, and the game's own swapchain carries every UI pixel.
//! - **Off the game loop.** GTK and WebKit are not thread-safe and must not run where JavaScript
//!   runs: that was measured, and pumping GTK between module evaluations broke rendering. So they
//!   own a thread, and the game loop never calls into either — it reads a mailbox.
//! - **A mailbox, not a queue.** At most one published frame is retained, latest wins, with a
//!   monotonic counter. The game either takes the newest frame or the one it already has.
//!
//! The frame the game gets is a cairo `ARGB32` surface read straight out of WebKit, which on a
//! little-endian host is `B,G,R,A` — premultiplied, because cairo's ARGB32 is. The composite side
//! uploads it as `BGRA8Unorm` and blends with `src = One`, which is what premultiplied means.
//!
//! **The web view must not use accelerated compositing.** A `GtkOffscreenWindow` has no `GdkWindow`
//! to host a GL surface, and WebKit does not fall back from that — it aborts the process with
//! "GDK is not able to create a GL context: The current backend does not support OpenGL" (measured;
//! `probe-gtk-offscreen` with `TN_GTK_COMPOSITING=1` exits 134). So `hardware_acceleration_policy`
//! is pinned to `Never` and the page rasterizes on the CPU inside the web process. That is the
//! measured cost this backend carries, and the reason the snapshot cadence below is demand-driven
//! rather than a fixed 60 Hz.

///   trip *plus* the interval — about 30 ms for the measured 14 ms round trip against the page's own
///   16 ms frame, half the rate the page was painting. With the deadline anchored at the request, a
///   round trip shorter than a frame leaves the next ask already due.
/// - A **wake during an in-flight request is not lost.** A post, an input or a resize that arrives
///   before the answer used to have its urgent deadline overwritten by the completion's backoff, so
///   the change the game just made waited out the idle poll. `settled` honours the pending wake.
/// - The backoff is **how long the page has been quiet, not how many identical answers arrived.** A
///   page painting at its own frame rate against a 16 ms poll legitimately answers with the same
///   pixels whenever two asks land inside one of its frames, and counting that as idleness doubled
///   the wait to 32 ms immediately: a hole wider than the frame it was pacing, in a stream that had
///   nothing wrong with it. `IDLE_INTERVAL` is what the old chain of doublings summed to
