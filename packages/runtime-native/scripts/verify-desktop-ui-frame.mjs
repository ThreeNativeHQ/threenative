/**
 * The native UI-frame gate: the page is composited into the game's own frame, and the game then
 * starts.
 *
 * PRD-393 gave the desktop host an in-frame UI composite. Every gate this repository had before
 * this one proved the game was alive and the UI bundle was *attached* — none of them could tell
 * "the page rendered" from "the page is on the screen". Two real defects shipped through all of
 * them, found only by a human playing the game: the HUD stretched on resize, and the page's CSS
 * animations never advanced. The loading-screen gate is the shape being mirrored here: drive the
 * real bundle through the real host, assert markers *and* pixels, and print the reason when a
 * marker says the feature is off rather than skipping the platform.
 *
 * What one run has to prove, in this order:
 *
 * 1. `TN_UI_OVERLAY:{"attached":true}` — the page was attached at all (fail closed, and print the
 *    reason when it is false);
 * 2. `TN_UI_COMPOSITE` reports `counter > 0` and `frame` equal to the scenario's viewport — the
 *    web view actually produced frames, at the size the game declared;
 * 3. a colour only the page paints is present in the game's *own* frame — the page ran and the page
 *    is on screen, which are two different assertions;
 * 4. the game then started: its own frame counter advanced after the UI was up, read from the
 *    resource series rather than from a marker that could have been emitted before it;
 * 5. `TN_UI_HIT_REGIONS` published the page's own rectangles — drawn is not routed;
 * 6. the `ui` phase exists in `TN_FRAME_BUDGET` and is under the bound PRD-393 accepted it at
 *    (2.0 ms p95, AC-6) — the same number, not a second one.
 *
 * Platform contract. On Linux the UI *is* a texture in the frame, so 2, 3 and 5 are all assertions
 * about the frame itself. Windows and macOS still attach a child web view that DWM and Quartz
 * composite, `platform::uiOverlayFrame()` returns false there, and the game's own frame therefore
 * cannot contain the page: this gate says so out loud (`contract: "child-window"`, and the
 * assertions it did not make are named in its evidence) rather than reporting the same green under
 * a weaker check. An unknown platform is refused, not guessed at.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/verify-desktop-ui-frame.mjs [--ui <dir>] [--contract in-frame|child-window]
 *
 * `--ui <dir>` is the built page to load. The default builds `examples/native-smoke/ui` and stages
 * it as `ui/` beside the runtime binary, which is where `attachUiOverlayIfConfigured` resolves an
 * empty-or-relative `uiRoot` and where the desktop packager puts it. Pointing it at a directory
 * that does not exist is the negative control for every assertion below: the host prints
 * `TN_UI_BUNDLE_MISSING` and exits, and this gate reports that line instead of a green.
