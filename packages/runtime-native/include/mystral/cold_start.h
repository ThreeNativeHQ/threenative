// Cold-start segment markers.
//
// PRD-070 opens on a hole rather than a regression: nothing in this repository measured launch
// time, so a 4x change in it could ship unnoticed the way a 50x frame-rate change already had.
// Every marker below is one boundary in the launch, stamped from a single monotonic clock so a
// reader subtracts two numbers rather than two log timestamps from two different clocks.
//
// The shape is deliberately dull and greppable:
//
//     TN_COLD_START:{"segment":"compile_begin","atMs":1234.567}
//
// `measure-cold-start.mjs` requires every segment it knows about and fails closed on a missing
// one. Adding a marker here without teaching that script about it is harmless; removing or
// renaming one fails the instrument, which is the intent.

/**
 * Brackets one JavaScript evaluation with the four launch segments the reader needs.
 *
 * PRD-328 opens on an instrument that could not run on the engine that ships: the compile and
 * execute markers existed only in `quickjs_engine.cpp`, which has not been the shipped engine on
 * any platform since 2026-08-16, so `measure-cold-start.mjs` failed closed with
 * `TN_COLD_START_MARKER_MISSING:compile_begin` on every real configuration and the desktop CLI
 * emitted no launch markers at all.
 *
 * Every engine reaches its entry bundle through a different member — V8 takes `eval` for an ESM
 * entry on desktop and `evalScript` for the Android bundle, JavaScriptCore folds both into
 * `evalWithResult` — and each of those members is also how nested CommonJS requires and worker
 * bootstrap run. Marking them all unconditionally would emit one set of segments per *module*.
 * So this counts nesting depth and marks only the outermost evaluation on the launch thread,
 * which is the bundle. Bootstrap scripts evaluated before the game are outermost too and emit
 * their own set; `game_eval_begin` is what tells the reader which set is the game's.
 *
 * Usage mirrors the shape `quickjs_engine.cpp` already writes by hand:
 *
 *     ColdStartEvalScope scope;              // compile_begin
 *     ... compile ...  scope.compiled();     // compile_complete
 *     scope.executing();                     // execute_begin
 *     ... run ...      scope.executed();     // execute_complete
 *
 * A failed compile or a thrown top-level simply stops marking, so a launch that did not finish
 * reports a missing marker rather than a total that never happened.
