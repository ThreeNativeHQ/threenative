/**
 * The browser-JS back end (PRD-532): three's class names as JS classes over the engine's C ABI
 * compiled to Wasm.
 *
 * The classes are built from the binding registry snapshot (`api/native-registry.json`): every class
 * the registry binds becomes a constructor whose prototype carries exactly that class's methods,
 * top-level getters and setters, and member objects. That is the surface the catalog marks supported
 * (`catalog-registry.spec.ts`), and nothing else. Dotted registry paths (`position.x`) are protocol
 * paths and stay off the prototype: `mesh.position.x` goes through the member object.
 *
 * One wrapper per engine handle, so identity survives (`mesh.position === mesh.position`); a
 * collected wrapper releases its object.
