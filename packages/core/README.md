# @threenative/core

## What it is

`@threenative/core` is the portable vanilla Three.js game runtime: `defineGame` wires the
renderer, fixed-step loop, scenes, lifecycle, input, state, plugins, and the build entry that
runs on web and native. It is not a visual-design system; your game owns materials, shaders,
lights, camera framing, and the look in its generated source.

## Install

Install the runtime with its Three.js dependency:

```sh
pnpm add @threenative/core three
```

## Example

In a generated `minimal` project, `src/game.ts` is a runnable game entry:

```ts
import { defineGame } from "@threenative/core";
import { playtest } from "@threenative/core/playtest";
import type { IPhysicsContext } from "@threenative/physics";
import { rapier } from "@threenative/physics";
import config from "../threenative.config.js";
import { Play } from "./scenes/Play.js";
import type { GameState } from "./state.js";

const game = defineGame<GameState, IPhysicsContext>({
  plugins: [rapier(), playtest()],
  render: config.renderer,
  scenes: { play: Play },
  start: "play",
});

export default game;
```
