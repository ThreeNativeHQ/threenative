/**
 * Three's `WebGPUTimestampQueryPool` holds 2048 queries and spends two per render pass. A
 * scene with a post-processing chain runs tens of passes per frame — a cathedral with SSGI,
 * denoise, godrays, SSR and bloom measured 27 — so the pool fills in under forty frames:
 *
 *   2048 queries / (2 per pass x 27 passes) = 37.9 frames
 *
 * Once full, three warns `Maximum number of queries exceeded` and stops recording, so
 * `renderer.info.render.timestamp` — the only thing `gpuFrameMs()` reads — goes stale and
 * every reported window carries `gpuMs: undefined`.
 *
 * The resolve was wired to the frame-budget window boundary, which is 300 frames by default.
 * That is eight times too slow to keep the pool from overflowing, and it defeats the stated
 * reason `trackTimestamp` is on unconditionally: *"This is the measurement itself"*, replacing
 * a record where "every GPU number was wall-clock algebra".
 *
 * `resolveTimestampsAsync` is fire-and-forget and already `.catch()`-guarded, so resolving per
 * frame does not put the GPU on the frame path — which was the original cadence's whole
 * concern.

/**
 * Three r185's `WebGPUTimestampQueryPool`, ported rather than paraphrased, because the whole bug is
 * in the parts a paraphrase drops:
 *
 * - `resolveQueriesAsync` returns the *previous* batch's `lastValue` unless there are un-resolved
 *   queries, and returns the *in-flight* promise — starting nothing — while one is outstanding
 *   (`three.webgpu.js:83619-83642`). So a resolve is skipped whenever the previous one has not come
 *   back by the time it is asked for.
 * - `_resolveQueries` empties the pool *before* submitting, then waits on `mapAsync` for its results
 *   (`three.webgpu.js:83668-83704`), so the answer lands several presented frames later.
 * - It answers with **one** number: the summed duration of the **last** frame in the batch
 *   (`three.webgpu.js:83746-83753`). Every other frame the batch measured is written to
 *   `timestamps`, keyed by uid, and never read again.
 *
 * The engine asked for a resolve on the same 1-in-8 stride it samples on, so the two facts above
 * compose into a sample count of `reportEvery / (8 x ceil(round-trip / 8))`: the stride is a frame
 * count and the round trip is not, so the count fell as the frame rate rose — 28 samples in a
 * 300-frame window at a slow frame rate, 1-2 in the ~200 fps windows of the 2026-10-03 Machinefall
 * probe, against the ~37 the sampler was asking for.
