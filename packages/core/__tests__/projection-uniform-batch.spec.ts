/**
 * PRD-449 R3, PRD-462. A lattice where every cube owns a material that differs from its neighbours
 * only in base colour — L4, and the shape a real game gets for free from cloning a material per
 * object.
 *
 * Before this, each of those materials keyed its own group, so the projection declined the scene as
 * not worth its own cost and 2,375 cubes were drawn one at a time. The claim these rows hold is
 * narrow and load-bearing: **one draw, one per-instance colour, and pixels identical to drawing
 * every material on its own.** The second half is the half an optimizer can silently lose, so every
 * row after the first mutates a *settled* scene and asks what the renderer was handed this frame.
 *
 * PRD-462 added the third half: a member whose material drifts for any reason *other* than colour
 * must still leave the group, and the default does that by proving a bounded slice of the materials
 * a frame rather than all of them. Rows that can tell spread from everyFrame therefore run under
 * both modes, and the bound the report states is asserted rather than assumed.
