/**
 * PRD-458: what a streamed world costs the shadow lane.
 *
 * Two costs, both measured on the 2 km walk. A change of records was handed to the levels as a
 * blanket `invalidateAll()`, so a tree 100 m from the follow point redrew the 48 m level whose
 * window does not reach it — ~4 fine renders a second against the ~1.7 a walk alone predicts. And
 * every wide level drew every wide caster, ground cover included: 615 draws a render on the 640 m
 * level, most of them ferns whose shadow is sub-texel noise at that range.
 *
 * The first is answered with the changed records' own bounds, which is a region the levels test
 * against their own windows; the second with a caster layer only the finest level renders. Both are
 * asserted through the real node: a region is checked against the level's own window, and a layer
 * by what that level's camera actually submits.
