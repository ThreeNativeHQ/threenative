 * The default that taught every template `maxFps: 60`.

 * Every scaffolded game shipped the line, so a 120 Hz desktop played at half its panel and an
 * agent that saw a soft picture had no way to know the config had already answered the question.
 * The default now follows the display, capped at 120, and mobile stays at 60 — and every number
 * here is one a harness can assert on, which is why the source is reported beside it.
