/**
 * The UI bridge — one message channel between the game and the UI, identical on every host.
 *
 * The UI runs in the platform's own browser-class renderer (a `WebView` on Android, a
 * `WKWebView` on iOS, a child web view on desktop) while the game runs in the native
 * runtime beside it. They are two JavaScript realms in, usually, two processes, so
 * everything that crosses is a message.
 *
 * Every host already offers a `MessagePort`-shaped primitive — `addWebMessageListener` on
 * Android, `WKScriptMessageHandler` on iOS, an IPC handler on desktop — so this file adopts
 * that shape rather than inventing one, and each host only has to fill in two slots:
 *
 * - **outbound**, a function that takes one JSON string;
 * - **inbound**, a global the host calls with one JSON string.
 *
 * On the web target there is no host and no second realm: the game and the UI are the same
 * page, so both ends connect to an in-process broker and the same `src/ui/` code runs
 * unchanged. That is the whole point — the transport differs, the protocol does not.
 *
 * Fail closed: a message that is not a JSON object with a string `type` throws on the way
 * out, and a malformed frame throws on the way in. A dropped message is a UI that silently
 * stops updating, which is the failure this refuses to have.
