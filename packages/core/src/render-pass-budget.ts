/**
 * Per-pass draw and triangle attribution, on by default, for every platform.
 *
 * The frame budget already owned the milliseconds; this owns the submissions. Three's
 * `renderer.info.reset()` runs once per frame before the world render, and a nested shadow or
 * reflection `renderer.render(...)` shares that same `info`, so `info.render` reports main plus
 * every nested pass combined. The aggregate cannot tell a 316-draw shadow lane from a 1,418-draw
 * colour pass, and every optimisation attempt had to hand-roll the split. This is the split: each
 * `render()` is one entry on a stack, and its own submissions are the counter delta across its
 * call minus the deltas of the nested calls it made, so the innermost active render call owns
 * exactly what it submitted.
 *
 * Three names its own shadow pass by temporarily renaming the scene to `Shadow Map [ ... ]`
 * (`renderShadow`), and a reflection pass names its scene with `Reflector` in it. Those are
 * borrowed, not invented: the classifier reads three's vocabulary and falls back to `nested`.
 *
 * Measurement, not policy: installing this alters no draw. `install` answers `undefined` on a
 * renderer whose `info.render` cannot be read, and a consumer must then report the pass split as
 * absent rather than zero.
 *
 * The main pass's own draws are also split by where their mesh came from, counted at the one place
 * a draw is counted — `info.update`, which every backend calls per submitted draw with the object
 * that owns it — so the sources sum to `draws` by construction instead of by an estimate beside it.
