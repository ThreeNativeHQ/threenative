/**
 * Why a launch stopped, said where the player can read it.
 *
 * A launch has exactly two ways to go wrong quietly, and both were measured on a real game:
 * progress stops moving (a decode that never returns, an asset that never settles) and the GPU
 * device is lost (another process had taken 94% of VRAM). In both the loop keeps iterating, the
 * loading layer keeps painting, and the only account of what happened is a line on stdout — which
 * a player does not have, and which a bug report therefore never carries.
 *
 * So the failure is reported as text, once, through `onLaunchFailure` — and core stops there. Core
 * cannot draw it: on the native host `document` is a Three.js compatibility stub whose
 * `appendChild` is a no-op, so an overlay written here would be invisible on exactly the target
 * that needs it. The page owns the presentation (and the copy-to-clipboard button players are
 * asked for when they report a launch that hung); this owns the noticing and the wording.
