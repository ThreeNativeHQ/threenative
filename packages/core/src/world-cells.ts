/**
 * One chunk's static meshes merged by material, in place, before the chunk is added.
 *
 * A hand-placed chunk is a bridge or a yard, not a prop: its mesh nodes are packed a few dozen to a
 * few hundred per file over a handful of materials, and each one is its own draw — in the main pass
 * and again in every shadow level that redraws it. Merging by material is what the cook already did
 * for repeated meshes (hence the `InstancedMesh`es in a loaded chunk), so this is the same fix one
 * step further out: one draw per material per chunk instead of one per node.
 *
 * Nothing here decides how anything looks. The merged mesh draws the game's own material and holds
 * the geometry exactly as authored, baked into the chunk root's space; what changes is how many
 * calls it takes to draw. `mergeByMaterial` does the bake and owns the refusals, so a group it
 * cannot merge (a material whose meshes disagree about `uv`) leaves the whole chunk as it was and is
 * counted as a failure — a chunk never disappears over a draw-call saving.
 *
 * Left alone: a skinned mesh (posed per frame), one carrying morph targets (the bake drops them), a
 * multi-material mesh (one draw per material already), and anything carrying a baked AutoLOD chain,
 * whose own `ModelLod` swaps its geometry and would be swapped for nothing. No chunk node is
 * animation-targeted: the chunk path takes `gltf.scene` and never a clip list.
 *
 * `disposeSources` says who owns the shapes the bake consumed. The merged buffers are the chunk's
 * own and are released with it on eviction; a shape nothing draws any more is released here, unless
 * the loader cache still holds it — `createAssetLoader` keys models by path and hands the same scene
 * back on the next load, so a cached shape is not this world's to tear down. A geometry a kept mesh
 * still draws is never released either way.
 *
 * `castShadow` says the chunk's shadow bill exists at all — the same answer the caller hands the
 * chunk's nodes — and only then is it worth one position-only proxy per `side`. See
 * `buildChunkShadowProxies`, which draws every side of every chunk with the world's one material for
 * that side.
 *
 * @returns what the merge did, or `undefined` when the bake refused the whole chunk.

/**
 * Stream a Blender-authored world package by cell and keep it resident around a followed point.
 *
 * The class composes `TerrainTiles` for the package's heightmap, builds one `InstancedBatch` per
 * resident cell asset run, distance level and mesh part, and loads hand-placed chunk GLBs through
 * `loadAll` + `addInSlices`. Ring residency, per-asset `maxDistance` filtering, the per-asset `lods`
 * levels, hard budgets and generation-tokened cancellation all live here; every geometry, material
 * and surface still comes from the package's GLBs and the game.
 *
 * An asset is drawn per part, not per model: a GLB with several primitives is one `InstancedBatch`
 * each, and a scattered part whose own material is transparent draws as an alpha cutout unless the
 * game asks for blending, because an `InstancedMesh` cannot sort its instances.
 *
 * An asset whose package entry names no `lods` is drawn at the levels its own model carries a baked
 * AutoLOD chain for: the levels an instanced draw cannot reach by itself, switched at the distance
 * their error projects over the `autoLod` viewport. Authored `lods` win; a chain is only a fallback.
 *
 * @situation stream a large Blender-authored world by cell instead of one huge GLB
 * @situation keep scattered props and hand-placed chunks resident around a moving player
 * @situation honour per-asset draw distances and hard streaming budgets without a mid-frame throw
 * @constraint surface is the game's; this class creates no material, colour or geometry
 * @constraint budgets are hard caps that report pressure instead of over-committing
 * @constraint model loads are bounded by `concurrency` (default 12) across every resident cell, not per cell
 * @constraint refilters are bounded by `rebuildsPerUpdate` (default 16) per update, nearest cell first
 * @constraint admission is bounded by `admissionBudgetMs` (default 2) per update across every path, plus at most one unit each for terrain and props; while props are queued terrain takes at most half, so neither starves the other, and a deferred cell keeps drawing what it has
 * @constraint SkinnedMesh parts are skipped; an instanced copy would draw one rest pose
 * @constraint a baked chain's switch distances are measured against `autoLod` (default 4 px of error over 60° and 1080 raster rows), because an instanced draw cannot select a level per instance; an asset with authored `lods` never consults it
 * @override ring, budgets, terrain tile size/resolution, terrain stream and collider radius, `transparentScatter`, `clusterSize` and `shadows.invalidate`, load `concurrency`, `rebuildsPerUpdate`, `admissionBudgetMs` and the package's per-asset maxDistance
 * @constraint `prewarmed` resolves once every prewarmed shared batch has been drawn; a game with a loading screen waits on it, and `stats().pendingPrewarm` is the same gate as a number
 * @constraint every `asset:level:part` is one InstancedMesh for the main pass, plus one caster InstancedMesh per world-grid square of `clusterSize` on the shadow caster layer, so the main pass draws one mesh per key and a shadow level submits only the squares it covers
 * @constraint two definitions the asset loader resolves to one model — the same cooked `glb`, the same `lods` at the same distances, the same `maxDistance` and bounds — are one asset under the lexicographically smallest id: one model load, one set of `asset:level:part` keys, one prewarm and one refcount, released when the last cell holding any member of the group leaves the ring; `TN_WORLD_ASSET_ALIAS` reports how many of the package's assets are really distinct
 * @constraint the main pass mesh draws only the squares the render camera's frustum covers — on by default, narrowed once per frame for every main batch by the engine's render-cadence dispatch, never for an orthographic camera — a batch with nothing to draw is hidden rather than submitted at `count 0`, and `TN_WORLD_MAIN_CULL` reports both every five seconds
 * @constraint a loaded chunk is merged by material before it is added, so it submits one draw per material rather than one per node; a skinned, multi-material or morph-target mesh, one carrying a baked AutoLOD chain, and an instanced mesh past `chunkMergeMaxTriangles` (default 43,690 triangles) or with a shape over 2,048 triangles, all keep their own geometry; a material group crossing 131,072 vertices (4 MiB of position + normal + uv) is split into several meshes in traversal order instead of one giant upload, indexed parts keep their index, and `TN_WORLD_CHUNK_MERGE` reports what the merge did and the bytes it left
 * @constraint `shadows.castDistance` is accepted and ignored (clusters replaced it); `shadows.invalidate` is called at most once a second after streamed records changed
 * @example
 * const world = await WorldCells.load({ url: "/world/world.json", surface, follow, ring: 1, budgets: { residentCells: 25, instances: 20000, bytes: 8000000 } });

   * This used to be each main mesh's own `onBeforeRender`, which three never calls for an invisible
   * mesh — so the moment a batch that draws nothing was hidden, the one thing that could show it
   * again when the camera turned back was gone with it, and the world lost its trees for good. The
   * decision therefore moved to the frame's own driver: the render-cadence compute dispatch, which
   * the engine already runs once per rendered frame — on the same readiness gate residency itself
   * sits behind, so a frame that skips this skipped the world's records too — and which now hands the
   * render camera to the world, so it reaches every main mesh whether it is drawn or not.
   *
   * The camera rules are the ones the hook had, and they are the whole of what decides a window:
   *
   * - **An orthographic camera never repacks.** A virtual-shadow level's camera is a
   *   `DirectionalLightShadow`'s own, which three makes orthographic, so a level's window — one shadow
   *   slice of the ring, deliberately not the main view's — can never overwrite the main pass's. A
   *   game whose own camera is orthographic keeps the old behaviour: everything resident is drawn, and
   *   nothing pops. That is a lost saving, never a wrong picture.
   * - **The render camera is the one that decides.** The engine dispatches this with the camera it
   *   is about to draw the main pass with, so the second-perspective-camera race the hook had to
   *   arbitrate per mesh cannot arise: a mirror or a minimap is drawn with its own camera and is
   *   served the main view's window, which is the honest trade for a world with one main view.
   * - **A set that did not change touches nothing.** The frustum, the visible cells and the epoch
   *   are the frame's, derived once for the whole pass; a batch whose records have not moved since it
   *   packed at that epoch compares two integers and returns. A camera at rest costs one frustum and
   *   one test per resident visibility cell a frame, and nothing at all per mesh.

   * asset in that span the level and cull answer is the same and the rebuild could change nothing,
   * and the position the batch was built from is kept so the next move is still measured from it.
   * What is genuinely stale is queued nearest cell first, `rebuildsPerUpdate` of them per call, and
   * the queue spends the frame's admission budget on them like any other build — so a refilter that
   * cannot be afforded this frame leaves the cell drawing the level it has, not a hole.

   * A path another owner still names is not released: two definitions that fetch the same bytes but
   * carry different `lods`/`maxDistance` are distinct assets, and the one leaving the ring must not
   * tear out a cached source the other still draws with. Keyed on the requested logical path, so a
   * path this world never asked for is never touched.

   * caller's: another game or world may hold the same cached model, so this world never drops a
   * cache entry it does not own — the caller's own `release` is where that lifetime ends.
