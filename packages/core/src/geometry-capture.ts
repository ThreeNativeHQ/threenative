/**
 * Per-object geometry cost, measured from what the renderer actually submitted.
 *
 * A total triangle counter cannot name the offender: a main character can cost 500 triangles while
 * a barely visible tree submits two million, and both land in the same number. `FrameBudget` stays
 * authoritative for a frame's per-pass totals; this attributes a slice of those totals to the
 * objects that caused them, and reconciles the two so the difference is visible rather than
 * assumed away.
 *
 * Three properties make it a measurement rather than a guess:
 *
 * 1. **It counts submissions, not scene contents.** The instrument is `onBeforeRender`, which the
 *    renderer calls once per object, per material group, per pass, *after* frustum and projected-
 *    size culling. A `visible` flag is a game's intent; a submission is what the GPU was handed.
 * 2. **It is armed only on request.** Nothing is installed, walked or counted until a consumer asks
 *    for one capture, and every hook is removed when that frame ends, is cancelled, or the scene
 *    exits. An idle game pays nothing.
 * 3. **It says "unavailable" with a reason.** A packed batch's per-member draws, an indirect
 *    counter with no readback, a geometry with no recoverable source detail: each is named, never
 *    reported as zero and never quietly dropped, and the unattributed remainder of every pass is
 *    reported beside the measured total.
 *
 * @situation find out which scene object is submitting the frame's triangles
 * @situation tell a cheap foreground character from an expensive distant prop
