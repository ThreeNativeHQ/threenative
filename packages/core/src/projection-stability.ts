/**
 * The proof that a frame's classification is the one the last frame already derived.
 *
 * The scan is a pure function of the scene's **structure** and reads no world matrix: membership,
 * each renderable's geometry, material and batching flags, its own and inherited visibility, and
 * the lane predicates over that geometry and material. Every one of those can change at any time,
 * so a frame may only skip the scan after proving the inputs are identical — and "identical" is
 * checkable cheaply, because a changed input has to show up as a changed *value*.
 *
 * So this keeps what the last scan read, in the order the scan read it, and compares. The
 * comparison is deliberately dumber than the classification: it reads the same fields the
 * predicates read and compares them, where re-running the predicates would cost what the skip is
 * for. Each distinct material and geometry is compared once per frame rather than once per object
 * that shares it, because those values are per-material and per-geometry — that is what makes a
 * 4,096-mesh scene cost a handful of extra reads instead of four thousand.
 *
 * What a move is *not*: the matrices. An object that animates every frame is still the same object
 * in the same group, so its matrix moving is not a reason to classify it again — the mirror's apply
 * writes that matrix into the baked draw every frame regardless, which is where a move belongs.
 *
 * A skip is only ever a *skip of the classification*. Everything the renderer is handed — batch
 * slots, stand-ins, mirrored lights, retirement — is still rebuilt by the apply seam each frame, so
 * a wrong answer here costs a re-scan and never a wrong picture.
