/**
 * A bounded observation of the pipelines a Three.js renderer actually asked the GPU device to make.
 *
 * This module deliberately knows the shape of Three's private render object, but not its cache-key
 * algorithm. Three owns the identity; the collector only reads the object at the backend boundary
 * where a cache miss becomes a real device creation. That keeps a material label from becoming a
 * pipeline key and makes the same observation useful on browser WebGPU and the native binding.
 *
 * The backend boundary alone is not the whole device, and a census that claims otherwise is
 * wrong by exactly the pipelines it cannot see: Three's texture pass utils build mipmap transfer
 * pipelines straight on the device, which is why a Bayview native capture logged 94 device
 * creations against 92 renderer events. So the device's own creation methods are observed too,
 * with creations reached through the wrapped backend attributed to their backend event rather
 * than counted twice, and a direct creation reported with the label the device was given, an
 * explicitly unknown pass and unknown provenance rather than the render object that happened to
 * be drawing when a texture uploaded.
