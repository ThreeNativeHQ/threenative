/**
 * The interactive-rect registry — how a touch decides whether it belongs to the UI or the game.
 *
 * A web view is a native view with a **rectangular** hit-test region owned by the platform.
 * CSS hit-testing happens inside that surface, after the native view has already claimed the
 * gesture, so `pointer-events: none` does not hand a touch back to the game beneath. It is a
 * useful property inside the page and it is not the pass-through mechanism.
 *
 * The mechanism is this: the page marks its interactive islands with `data-tn-interactive`,
 * this registry publishes where they are, and the native input host does the hit test before
 * either surface sees the gesture.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <button data-tn-interactive onClick={restart}>Restart</button>
 * ```
 *
 * Three properties make it correct, and each one is a defect this file exists to prevent:
 *
 * - **Published, never queried.** The host owns a snapshot. Asking the page per touch means an
 *   async round trip inside the input path: latency, and a race with the frame that moved it.
 * - **Decided on pointer-down, held to pointer-up.** That rule belongs to the host, because
 *   only the host sees the whole gesture; this file just keeps the snapshot true.
 * - **Republished per frame while a transition is live.** A sliding menu is drawn where the
 *   compositor put it this frame, and a rect published before the slide points at empty space.
 *
 * Rects are **normalized to the viewport**, 0..1, so no host has to know about CSS pixels,
 * device pixel ratio, or the page's zoom to place them on its own surface. That is also what
 * lets a sibling-layer host and an offscreen-texture host read the same payload.
