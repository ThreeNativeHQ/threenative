/**
 * Bake a hierarchy's static meshes into one mesh per material, transforms and all.
 *
 * A building or a ship is dozens of boxes and cylinders that never move relative to each other, and
 * every one of them is a draw call. Grouping by material and merging each group is the ordinary
 * fix, and the ordinary fix is thirty lines an agent rewrites in every game, each time slightly
 * differently: walk the tree, group by material, bake `matrixWorld` into the vertices, hand the
 * group to `mergeParts`, build a mesh on the game's own material. The parts here are the same
 * `IMergePart` list, so a game that already merges by hand gets the same refusals — a group that
 * cannot merge throws naming `label:material`, not silently vanishing.
 *
 * Nothing here decides how anything looks: the material is the game's own instance, the geometry is
 * exactly what was authored, and the group split follows the materials the game already made.
 *
 * `normal` survives when every mesh in a group carries it and is recomputed otherwise. `uv` survives
 * when any mesh carries it, so a group where only some do is the refusal `mergeParts` raises, never
 * a texture silently left unmapped. Skinned meshes are left alone — their vertices are posed per
 * frame — and an instanced one is left alone unless `expandInstancedUnderTriangles` names a cap its
 * group fits under and its own shape is small enough to be worth repeating, which bakes every
 * instance matrix into the merge.
 *
 * `maxGroupVertices` bounds a single group, and a material whose parts cross it is merged into
 * several meshes in traversal order — more draws, none of them carrying a buffer big enough to stall
 * the frame that first submits it.
