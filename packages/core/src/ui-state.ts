/**
 * What crosses the bridge, in both directions: published state out, intents back.
 *
 * The UI is a different realm from the game on every native target, so it cannot hold the game
 * object, subscribe to its store, or call its methods. It holds a **mirror** — the last state
 * the game published — and it sends **intents**, which the game is free to ignore.
 *
 * That asymmetry is deliberate and it is what keeps one `src/ui/` honest. A HUD written against
 * a live store works on web and silently has nothing to read on a phone; a HUD written against
 * the mirror behaves identically on both, because on web the mirror is fed by the same
 * publication through an in-process channel.
 *
 * Publications are **coalesced**: many store writes inside one turn produce one frame. React
 * must never re-render on the game loop, and neither may the bridge carry a frame per tick.
 */

/**
 * The minimum a store must offer to be published.
 *
 * `getPublishedState` is optional and preferred when present: ThreeNative's game store keeps a
 * live `getState()` that moves every tick and a `getPublishedState()` that moves at most ten
 * times a second. The UI wants the throttled one — the live one would put a bridge frame on
 * every tick, which is the thing React must never do.
