/**
 * The oracle for terrain geometry that is otherwise trusted every frame.
 *
 * `TerrainTiles` re-derives what it already knows — every rendered vertex checked for finiteness,
 * every resident seam re-measured, every LOD blend's visible displacement sampled — and that is a
 * measurement, not a mechanism: on a 289-tile ring a six-second walk paid ~270 ms in three loops
 * that only throw when something is already broken. So it is off by default and the shipped frame
 * trusts the cheap change detector instead, which compares buffer versions and the residency and
 * LOD state the class writes itself.
 *
 * `TN_TERRAIN_VALIDATE=1`, `?tnTerrainValidate=1`, or `validate: true` on the constructor puts the
 * loops back and every assertion with them. It is a validation mode, not a proof: it proves the
 * frames it ran on.
