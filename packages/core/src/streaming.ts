/**
 * Two load-time mechanisms every streaming game writes by hand, and gets wrong in the same places.
 *
 * A game that shows a loading curtain and builds its world behind it has two loops that decide how
 * long the curtain stays up, and neither is about how anything looks: the loop that **fetches** the
 * models and the loop that **attaches** the finished objects to the scene. Written naively, the
 * first is serial and the second is one-object-per-frame, and both are slow for reasons that have
 * nothing to do with the game.
 *
 * Measured in a real game (a 190 m valley, ~70 GLBs, ~400 attached objects), on the same build and
 * the same content:
 *
 * | Attach loop  | Detail tier |
 * | ------------ | ----------- |
 * | 1 per frame  | 16.5 s      |
 * | 6 per frame  | 11.26 s     |
 * | 24 per frame | 9.39 s      |
 * | 256 per frame| **6.89 s**  |
 * | all at once  | 7.18 s      |
 *
 * and the fetch loop: 52 models one at a time took **38.4 s**; six at a time took **8.8 s**.
 *
 * Neither of these decides how anything looks. `addInSlices` never creates an object and never
 * chooses where it goes — it is handed a list and the game's own `add`. `loadAll` never chooses
 * what to load — it is handed a list and the game's own `load`. Geometry, material, colour,
 * texture, curve and timing stay with the game in both, and a game can change its appearance
 * completely without editing either.
 *
 * What they are not is code a game can get right portably by itself, which is why they live here.
 * Yielding correctly is a platform seam: awaiting `requestAnimationFrame` deadlocks a host whose
 * frames are pumped by the code doing the waiting, racing it against a timer reorders the frame
 * sequence a harness observes, and a hard-coded `setTimeout(16)` is neither a frame on the native
 * runtime nor a frame on a machine that cannot hold 60. See `yieldToHost` in `warmup.ts` for the
 * two wrong versions that came before the one both of these use.
