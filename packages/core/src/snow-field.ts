/**
 * Persistent snow deformation over one canonical heightfield.
 *
 * Snow keeps four channels per cell — indentation, displaced bank, compaction and disturbance —
 * and writes the combined surface (`terrain + depth + bank - indent`) back into the heightfield
 * it was given. Queries, rendered geometry and collider export therefore all read one surface,
 * and no second terrain representation exists.
 *
 * The field is numeric only: it never chooses a boot, a tread, a particle, a material or a
 * camera. Games supply terrain heights, the snow depth, the contact profile and the response
 * coefficients; this class owns the storage, the load-dependent penetration and the bounded
 * recovery. It is a heightfield approximation — not granular snow, displaced-volume
 * conservation, avalanches, melting or a calibrated material law.
 * @situation leave footprints, tracks and tyre ruts in snow that persist and fill in over time
 * @situation let a pushed sphere carve a connected track and a dropped one settle into a crater
 * @situation store snow deformation that rendered geometry and collision both read
 * @situation reset a snowfield between rounds or change its depth at runtime
 * @situation show how packed the snow is where people have walked or objects have rested
 * @constraint the field composes onto a Heightfield; construct the terrain first and let this own the surface
 * @constraint zero depth is bare ground: contacts register no indentation at all
 * @constraint out-of-region heightAt and normalAt follow Heightfield's error contract; sample returns zeros
 * @override depth, hardness, yieldFraction, maxBank and responseTime name the response coefficients
 * @requires @threenative/core/world Heightfield as the canonical terrain and surface
 * @example import { Heightfield } from "@threenative/core/world";
 * const terrain = Heightfield.fromSampler({ rows: 129, columns: 129, width: 64, depth: 64, origin: { x: 0, z: 0 }, sampleHeight: (x, z) => Math.sin(x * 0.1) * 0.5 });
