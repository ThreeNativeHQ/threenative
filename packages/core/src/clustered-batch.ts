 * and a copy two hundred metres away do not draw the same triangles.
 *
 * **Why instances are bucketed rather than cut one by one.** One indexed draw has one index range,
 * and multi-draw indirect is not portably available on this stack, so *n* different cuts would mean
 * *n* draws and *n* index buffers — on four hundred boulders that is a gigabyte of index data to
 * save vertex work. Instead the copies are grouped by distance, one cut is taken per occupied
 * group, and each group draws as one instanced draw. Every group's cut is a real cut of the DAG and
 * therefore watertight; the group is cut at the distance of its *nearest* member, so no copy is ever
 * drawn coarser than its own distance allows — only finer, by at most the width of one group.
