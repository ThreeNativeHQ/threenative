/**
 * The per-frame world-matrix walk, with a hidden subtree left where it stands.
 *
 * `three`'s `Object3D.updateMatrixWorld` recurses into every child of every node whatever its
 * `visible` flag, multiplying a world matrix for each. That is the correct default for a library
 * that cannot know what a game is doing, and it is the wrong one for a renderer that is about to
 * skip exactly those subtrees: a full-detail body while its merged stand-in draws, a hidden LOD
 * level, a parked or hangared model each pay the walk and none of them can draw.
 *
 * Native flight in `sandbox/midway-open-pacific` profiled `updateMatrixWorld` plus
 * `multiplyMatrices` at **29 % of all JavaScript ticks**, and the same scene's hand-rolled
 * visible-only pass walked **779 nodes per frame instead of 9,903**, 3.1 ms down to 0.3 ms. That
 * pass was the game's; this is the engine's, so the next game does not write it again.
 *
 * The pass mirrors three exactly for a visible node: `matrixAutoUpdate` -> `updateMatrix()`, then
 * the `matrixWorldNeedsUpdate || force` recompute honouring `matrixWorldAutoUpdate` and a null
 * parent, then force the children. A node with `visible === false` still composes its **own**
 * matrix — that is what makes the next part cheap — and is not recursed into; when it was forced
 * (or carried a dirty flag) it is remembered, so the first frame it is visible again its whole
 * subtree is recomputed with `force = true`.
 *
 * Two things are never dropped by the pruning, because both are read while nothing above them is
 * visible:
 *
 * - a class that overrides `updateMatrixWorld` runs its own — never a `Scene`, which three does not
 *   override and whose method only differs when something patched the prototype. `SkinnedMesh`
 *   refreshes `bindMatrixInverse`, `Camera` its `matrixWorldInverse`; re-implementing only the base
 *   walk left every deck-crew sailor that had moved since load drawing with a stale bind matrix and
 *   vanishing from the frame. Their subtrees are small, so walking them whole costs nothing;
 * - a hidden node that holds a `Bone` is walked, because a visible `SkinnedMesh` draws with its
 *   skeleton's matrices wherever the armature happens to sit. Whether bones sit below a node is
 *   decided once and remembered — a rig is built whole and does not grow.
 *
 * A third thing is dropped, and it is the walk's largest single share on a streamed world: a subtree
 * frozen with `markStatic`. `markStatic` composes the subtree once and turns off the two flags that
 * would recompose it, which until now still left three's unconditional recursion visiting every node
 * under it every frame. A frozen root that carries no dirty flag is a leaf here, and it is one
 * whether the walk was forced or not: `refreshStaticTransforms` re-arms a root whose own transform
 * moved, `invalidateStatic` re-arms one something wrote inside, and both compose the subtree once at
 * that moment. `isStatic` is what separates the engine's freeze from a game that turned the flags off
 * for its own reasons. See `static-transform.ts`.
 *
 * A game that reads a **hidden** object's `matrixWorld` directly must not rely on this pass
 * having reached it: use `getWorldPosition`/`getWorldQuaternion`/`getWorldScale` (which update the
 * chain they need) or call `object.updateWorldMatrix(true, false)` first. The convention's named
 * override is `renderer.matrixWorld: "all"`, which visits every node exactly as three's own walk
 * does; `"visible"` is the default.
