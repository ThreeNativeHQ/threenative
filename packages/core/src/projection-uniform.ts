/**
 * The fingerprint a uniform batch is keyed on, and the per-frame proof a member still matches it.
 *
 * A group of meshes that share a geometry and a material differing **only in base colour** draws as
 * one instanced call with the colour carried per instance, so the draw's only job is to know which
 * materials are interchangeable. That question has two halves, and both are affordable every frame
 * for a scene of four thousand materials:
 *
 * - **At classification**, a material's own properties become a signature string, and the values
 *   behind it are cached by position. Two materials with the same signature differ in nothing a
 *   shader can see except the colour.
 * - **Per frame**, the material's own values are read back in one `Object.values` call and compared
 *   against that cache. Everything is compared by identity, which is what a swap is, except the
 *   small-object types three clones per material — a `Color`, a `Vector2`, an `Euler` — which a game
 *   mutates in place, so their components are read instead. A property the group cannot carry
 *   (`color` travels per instance, `defines` is walked shallowly beside this, and the identity
 *   fields are no draw's business) is skipped rather than watched, and the number of own properties
 *   is compared, because a game that attaches a draw-affecting one after the fact would otherwise be
 *   invisible here and the group would keep drawing it with a shared material that never had it.
 *
 * The comparison is deliberately a value compare and nothing else. `material.version` is not part of
 * it, because `material.needsUpdate = true` bumps it without changing a pixel, and a material that
 * set it every frame would then be reclassified every frame for nothing. Every change that *can*
 * move a pixel is a change to one of the values read here, so the values are the whole truth and
 * the version is not.
