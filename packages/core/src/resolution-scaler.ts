   *  - **the median present is over the target's period.** An unlocked renderer holding a steady
   *    17.24 ms against a 16.67 ms budget shows up here and nowhere else: its tail is as tight as
   *    its middle, and it is simply doing too much work every frame.
   *  - **the tail is past `tailMs`.** Under FIFO an interval is a whole number of panel periods,
   *    so a game that misses a real share of its vsyncs moves p95 to two periods in one jump —
   *    the 45 fps window the device arm chose the mean signal for. There is nothing in between to
   *    fall through: `upTailFraction` sits in the empty gap between one period and two.
   *
   * When neither speaks, the deficit is a handful of doubled intervals in an otherwise on-budget
   * window: jitter from the compositor, a GC, an input burst, an audio callback. None of that is
   * bought back with pixels, and spending a rung on it is how the picture walks to the floor.
