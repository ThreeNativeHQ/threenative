/**
 * The hierarchical-depth (pyramid) occlusion test, and the max-distance pyramid it reads.
 *
 * The pyramid is a previous frame's own depth, reduced so that one texel of a level covers `2^level`
 * pixels of the level below it and every texel holds the *farthest* surface inside its footprint.
 * Farthest, not nearest: a sphere is only hidden when its nearest point is behind the farthest
 * thing already drawn in front of it, so a max reduction is the conservative direction and a min
 * reduction would reject objects a fragment can still see.
 *
 * Two readers, one rule. {@link occludedBy} is the reference in plain TypeScript and
 * {@link DepthPyramid.occluded} is the same rule in TSL for the cull kernel. Four answers are never
 * "hidden", and each is a case the test has to get right rather than a tuning choice:
 * - a camera cut — a teleport or a projection change — skips the test for the whole frame, because
 *   the pyramid is a different camera's depth;
 * - a sphere that touches the near plane has no last-frame screen rect to compare against;
 * - a sphere that fell off screen last frame has no texel to read;
 * - a sphere whose footprint is a single texel at every level is kept, because the level it would
 *   need does not exist and a coarser level would reject it wrongly.
 *
 * Nothing here decides a look: the test reads depths and answers a boolean.
