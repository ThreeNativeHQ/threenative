/**
 * The node form of a cutout whose alpha survives the mip chain: Ben Golus's mip-level alpha
 * compensation, as a dynamic `alphaTestNode`.
 *
 * Alpha-test a mipped alpha and distance deletes the surface. A 2048px needle card is nine percent
 * opaque; at 100 m it is sampled from mip five or six, where the box filter has averaged the card
 * down to about 0.1, and `discard` at 0.5 throws every needle away — a forest drawn as bare trunks.
 * Compensating by the mip level is the standard repair: the deeper the mip the smaller the effective
 * cutoff, because a deeper mip is a coarser question about the same texel, not a stricter one.
 *
 * The threshold is a *node* rather than a number so it reads the mip the fragment is actually on,
 * which depends on distance, on screen size and on how the game scaled the card. `alphaTest` keeps
 * the authored cutoff for every reader that only understands a number (`AlphaAntialiasing` counts
 * the cutout by it), and the discard and the alpha-to-coverage ramp both read the node.
 *
 * Where the coverage mask is on, three resolves the edge itself —
 * `smoothstep(alphaTestNode, alphaTestNode + fwidth(alpha), alpha)`, the derivative ramp Golus's
 * first pass spells out by hand — so the sharpen is not repeated here; applying it twice would
 * narrow the edge to half a pixel.
 *
 * What it never decides: the cutoff, the map, the colours, the geometry. Those are the game's; this
 * only stops the sampler from throwing them away.
