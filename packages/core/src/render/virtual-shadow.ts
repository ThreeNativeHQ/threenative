 * tracked caster draws into a second, per-level mover map every frame, and a fragment takes the
 * darker of the two — so a walking stag costs one small render of itself, not a render of the wood.
 *
 * Plugs into three's own slot, so every material in the scene receives it with no other change:
 * `light.shadow.shadowNode = new VirtualShadowNode(light, { clipExtents: [16, 48, 144] })`.
 *
 * What it owns is mechanism: level windows, texel snapping, per-level caching, invalidation,
 * level selection and the statistics. The light's `shadow` keeps bias, normal bias, intensity,
 * map type and filter, and those source settings are mirrored into each stock level node before
 * rendering. Per-level map sizes, cameras, `autoUpdate` and `needsUpdate` are owned by this node.
 * Each level is rendered by the stock {@link ShadowNode} through the renderer's shadow-map type,
 * so the look is the same code path a plain shadow uses. At most one level renders per frame,
 * finest first — a level render is a whole scene draw, and a level passed over keeps the map and
 * window it has, so a fragment only ever samples a map that level drew.
 *
 * Ported from the virtual-shadow-map prototype's clipmap and invalidation; the sparse page atlas
 * is deliberately not the first cut — a page needs the scene rendered once per page, and on a
 * forest of hundreds of instanced meshes three level renders are cheaper than twenty-four page
 * renders. The page pool and demand pass in `virtual-shadow-pages.ts` stay ready for it.
 *
 * @situation crisp shadows close to the player across a large outdoor level
 * @situation shadow map too coarse over a big terrain
 * @situation one directional light shadow for a whole open world
 * @situation shadows shimmer when the camera moves
 * @constraint the light must be a DirectionalLight with `castShadow` and a target in the scene
 * @constraint clipExtents are half-widths in world units, finest first, strictly increasing
 * @constraint call `trackCaster(object)` for movers; it enables layer `VIRTUAL_SHADOW_MOVER_LAYER` on the object and its descendants, tracking or untracking refreshes cached levels once, and subsequent mover movement refreshes only when a window moves
 * @override bias, biasNode, normalBias, intensity, radius, blurSamples, mapType and filterNode stay on `light.shadow`; mapSize and the other options here have defaults
 * @override followViewFocus: false keeps eye follow; receiverPlaneBias: false uses only authored bias
 * @example
 * const sun = new DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 3);
 * sun.castShadow = true;
 * sun.shadow.shadowNode = new VirtualShadowNode(sun, { clipExtents: [12, 40, 120] });
