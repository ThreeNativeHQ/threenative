 * An outdoor daylight rig: a physical sky that stays on the eye, one sun whose open-world shadow
 * windows follow the eye (`VirtualShadowNode`), a hemisphere fill, sky-coloured distance haze and
 * the AgX tone curve at the game's exposure. It is plumbing, not a look: every colour, angle,
 * intensity and density is a required option, and the rig adds nothing a game did not ask for.
 *
 * Add it with `ctx.add(daylight)`: `attachRenderer` sets tone mapping, exposure and the shadow map
 * once, and `process` (render cadence) keeps the sky box, the sun and its target on the eye every
 * frame, so a 2 km map never walks out of its own sky or shadow.
 *
 * @situation daytime sky, sun and shadows for a large outdoor map
 * @situation distant terrain should fade into the sky instead of a coloured wall
 * @situation match a Blender look-dev scene's sun, sky and exposure in the game
 * @constraint every value is required; there is no default sun, sky, haze or exposure
 * @constraint `skySize` must keep the sky box's corners inside the camera's far plane
 * @constraint shadowExtents follow `VirtualShadowNode`: half-widths, finest first, strictly increasing
 * @override sky uniforms stay live on `daylight.sky`; the light and fill are `daylight.sun` and `daylight.fill`
 * @example
 * const daylight = new Daylight({ follow: ctx.camera, sunDirection, sunColor, sunIntensity: 4, shadowExtents: [24, 96, 320], sky: { turbidity: 3, rayleigh: 1.4, mieCoefficient: 0.004, mieDirectionalG: 0.8 }, fill: { sky, ground, intensity: 1.1 }, haze: { color: horizon, density: 0.0011 }, exposure: 2 ** -0.6, skySize: 1600 });
