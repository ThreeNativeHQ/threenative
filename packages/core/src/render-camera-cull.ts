/**
 * Do not submit what the render camera cannot resolve.
 *
 * Every 3D game eventually pays for the same mistake: a distant roster, a far hull, a prop that
 * projects to a fraction of a pixel still costs a full draw submission — measured at roughly 14 µs
 * per draw on the GPU-free CPU path — while contributing nothing a player can see. The engine
 * knows the render camera, the object's world bounds and the drawing-buffer height, so it can take
 * that draw without the game discovering the rule by hand.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately narrow, and it never acts on a bound it cannot trust. An object is
 * skipped only when its **world bounding sphere** projects to fewer pixels than
 * {@link DEFAULT_MINIMUM_PROJECTED_PIXELS} *in the camera about to render it*, and only when
 * nothing offers a reason to keep it: {@link alwaysRender}, a shadow caster, a camera-attached
 * object, an object that already set `frustumCulled = false`, or a bound that is absent,
 * degenerate (a zero or non-finite radius is not a size) or stale (the position buffer was
 * rewritten after the sphere was computed — a changed buffer is recomputed, never trusted). The
 * one flag it writes is `Object3D.visible`,
 * which three reads after batch grouping; `castShadow`, `layers` and `frustumCulled` are never
 * touched, because flipping those per frame churns the projection's batch key and can make the
 * whole scene decline.
 *
 * The default is conservative on purpose. An object whose projected diameter is below one pixel
 * cannot cover a whole pixel of the frame; **0.5 px** is half of that bound and four times more
 * conservative than the 2 px a shipped game tuned by a pixel-diff ladder. A game that measured its
 * own scenery and wants more names a larger `renderer.minimumProjectedPixels`.
 */

/**
 * The projected diameter, in raster pixels, below which an object is not submitted.
 *
 * Half a pixel is the conservative rung: it removes only objects that cannot light a full pixel,
 * rather than the objects a 2 px ladder removed. A game that wants the tuned cut sets
 * `renderer.minimumProjectedPixels` on the same object it would have hand-rolled.
