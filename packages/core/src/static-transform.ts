/**
 * Authored static subtrees: stop recomposing transforms that nobody moves.
 *
 * The matrix walk is 2.22 ms of the reference game's 16.1 ms render phase, and almost none of what
 * it recomputes changed since the previous frame — island geometry, deck fittings, static props and
 * terrain are composed from the same position, quaternion and scale every frame, then multiplied
 * into the same world matrix, for as long as the game runs.
 *
 * **What this deletes, exactly, so the claim can be checked.** Three's `updateMatrixWorld` does
 * three things per object: `updateMatrix()` composes the local matrix when `matrixAutoUpdate`,
 * the world matrix is multiplied out when `matrixWorldNeedsUpdate || force`, and the walk recurses
 * into every child — the recursion is unconditional in three 0.185, so a frozen subtree still gets
 * visited. Freezing removes the two composes and keeps the visit. That is the honest bound: this
 * deletes arithmetic, not traversal, and the traversal is a separate lever with a separate PRD.
 *
 * **Staticness is authored, never guessed.** A heuristic that decides an object has "not moved in
 * 60 frames" is a correctness bug with no reproduction, so nothing here watches gameplay. What the
 * engine does do is check the promise where it is cheap to check it: the root's own local transform
 * is compared against what was frozen, once per frame, and a root the author moved thaws and
 * refreezes itself. That is O(static roots), not O(objects), and it turns the most common way to
 * get this wrong into a non-event. Writes deeper inside a frozen subtree are the author's to
 * announce with `invalidateStatic`, and `TN_RENDERLIST_VALIDATE=1` is what proves they did.
