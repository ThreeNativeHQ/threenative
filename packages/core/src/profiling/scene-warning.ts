/**
 * The engine telling the agent that built the scene what a human would otherwise find by playing.
 *
 * A scene reached 1,815 triangles per draw with its GPU ten times under budget and nobody knew,
 * because the census and the phase split are measured every frame and nothing reads them. The
 * frame already carries the shape: how many objects the cull considered, how many draws each pass
 * submitted, how many casters are exempt, and what share of the frame the GPU actually used. This
 * turns those numbers into a verdict, once per reported window.
 *
 * **The rule is derived, never a constant an author is told to revisit.** It fires when
 *
 *  - the GPU used less than a third of the frame — the device is not the constraint, and
 *  - the JS render phase alone is longer than the display's own period — so the scene cannot make
 *    the display's rate even if everything else in the frame were free.
 *
 * Both numbers come from the frame meter. The display's period comes from the host's own
 * presentation cap where there is one, and otherwise from the frame rate the game itself declared;
 * no third source is invented, and a launch that can name neither gets no verdict rather than a
 * guessed one.
 *
 * It is silent on an honestly GPU-bound scene with the same draw count, which is the property that
 * makes it worth reading: a warning that fires on every heavy scene is a warning nobody reads.
