/**
 * Host-boundary counters, default-off, on the frame budget's own record.
 *
 * Two of the three hypotheses about the render phase's unattributed time are about crossings and
 * bytes — "the V8↔host boundary dominates" and "a buffer write per object per pass dominates" —
 * and neither can be answered by a JS CPU profile, because the time is spent on the other side of a
 * call the profiler attributes to a single frame. This counts the calls instead.
 *
 * What it counts, precisely, because a counter that overstates itself is worse than none:
 *
 *  - `hostCalls` — every WebGPU method invoked on the device's command encoders and on its queue.
 *    On a native host each of those is one crossing; in a browser it is one API call. It is not
 *    every crossing a frame makes: `mapAsync`, `getCurrentTexture` and the presentation path are
 *    issued by three and by the host outside these objects, and they are named here rather than
 *    folded in so the number can be checked against a host that counts its own.
 *  - `gpuBytes` — the byte count handed to `queue.writeBuffer`, exactly. Texture uploads are not
 *    included: a `writeTexture` size is a function of the destination's format, and estimating it
 *    from `data.byteLength` would be a number nobody could reconcile.
 *  - `jsAllocBytes` — the change in `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize`, where the platform has it.
 *    Absent on a host without `performance.memory`, never zero: an unmeasurable allocation rate and
 *    a frame that allocated nothing are different facts.
 *
 * Wrapping every method of a command encoder is not free — it is one extra JS call per command, and
 * this is why the counters ride the same opt-in flag as the spans rather than being always on.
