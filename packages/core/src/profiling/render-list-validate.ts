 * the difference falsifiable: with `TN_RENDERLIST_VALIDATE=1`, every frame recomputes every world
 * matrix from the authored transforms, the long way, and compares it elementwise against the one
 * the frame is about to draw with. The first disagreement throws, naming the object and the
 * element, because a validation mode that logs and continues is a validation mode nobody reads.
 *
 * It is a validation mode, not a proof: it proves the frames it ran on. Run it on the scenes you
 * care about, in CI, for as many frames as you can afford.
 *
 * Off by default and expensive by construction — it does the work it is checking, twice.
