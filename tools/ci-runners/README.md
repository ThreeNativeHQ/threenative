# Self-hosted CI runners (`tn-local`)

Linux CI jobs can run on one owner machine instead of GitHub's hosted runners. Hosted runners stay the
fallback for everything, so **contributors need none of this**: a clone, a fork or a pull request works
the same with or without it. The design and its measurements are in
[PRD-480](../../docs/PRDs/CI/PRD-480-linux-ci-runs-on-the-owner-machine.md).

## How routing works

Every movable Linux job picks its runner from one expression:

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ (github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork || !vars.TN_RUNNER) && 'ubuntu-24.04' || vars.TN_RUNNER }}
```

- `TN_RUNNER` (repository variable) set to `tn-local` → the job runs on this pool. Unset → hosted.
- A pull request from a fork always runs hosted, so outside code never reaches the machine.
- Small join jobs (`scope`, `ci-required`, summaries) use `TN_RUNNER_LIGHT` the same way, so they never
  queue behind a 20-minute build.
- macOS, Windows, iOS, linux-arm64, `supply-chain` and the Android emulator lane always run hosted.

**The pool is extra capacity, not a replacement.** This repository is public, so hosted runners are free
and run about 20 jobs at once. A balancer (`ci-runners.sh balance`, started by `up`) sets each variable
only while that pool has an idle runner, and deletes it the moment none is idle. A busy pool therefore
overflows new jobs to hosted runners instead of queueing them. Routing every Linux job here funnelled the
team's CI into 5 slots and made boards slower. `down` stops the balancer and clears both variables, so a
pool that is down never strands a job.

## Set it up (once, on the runner machine)

Needs: Linux with systemd, Docker usable without `sudo`, `gh` logged in with admin rights on the repo,
and at least 6 CPU cores (each slot takes 2 whole cores, and 2 stay free for the desktop).

1. Create a fine-grained token for this repository only, with **Administration: Read and write**. It
   mints runner registration tokens. Add **Variables: Read and write** too if the pool must also start
   before anyone logs in (see Troubleshooting).
2. Store it outside the repository, readable only by you:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/threenative
   printf 'RUNNER_ADMIN_TOKEN=%s\n' '<token>' > ~/.config/threenative/runners.env
   chmod 600 ~/.config/threenative/runners.env
   ```

3. In the repository settings, set Actions → General → "Fork pull request workflows from outside
   collaborators" to **Require approval for all outside collaborators**.
4. Install:

   ```sh
   pnpm ci:runners:install
   ```

   It checks the prerequisites and creates `.worktrees/ci-runners` (a checkout the service owns). It
   then installs and starts a systemd user service, `threenative-ci-runners`, enabling lingering so the
   service starts at boot. The pool comes up and the variables are set. Nothing else to run, now or
   after a reboot.

## Day to day

| Want | Run |
|---|---|
| What is running, what is routed | `pnpm ci:runners status` (balancer log: `~/.local/state/threenative/ci-runners/balance.log`) |
| Pick up a runner image or script change from `develop` | `systemctl --user restart threenative-ci-runners` (when no job is running; a restart kills in-flight jobs) |
| Send every job to hosted runners now (kill switch) | `gh variable delete TN_RUNNER && gh variable delete TN_RUNNER_LIGHT` |
| Stop the pool | `systemctl --user stop threenative-ci-runners` |
| Remove everything | `pnpm ci:runners uninstall` |
| Run without the service (any OS with Docker) | `pnpm ci:runners up [N]` / `pnpm ci:runners down` |

Every start re-checks out the latest `develop`, so fixes to `tools/ci-runners/` deploy on the next
restart or reboot.

## What a slot is

- An ephemeral container per job (`docker run --rm`): fresh filesystem, fresh hostname, no state
  shared between jobs. The image is Ubuntu 24.04 plus what hosted `ubuntu-24.04` jobs rely on: Node 20,
  `gh`, Rust, JDK 17, Android SDK and platform-tools, build tools, Xvfb and Playwright's dependencies.
- 5 heavy slots, each pinned to 2 whole cores (`nproc` reads 4, like a hosted runner) with 12 GB of
  memory and no extra swap. Under memory pressure the kernel kills a CI job before anything else.
- 3 light slots: 1 CPU and 2 GB each, for joins only. One slot serialised every pull request's scope and
  verdict, because an ephemeral runner takes 30-60 s to re-register after each job.
- The admin token mints one registration token per container and is unset before the job starts, so no
  job can read it.

## Troubleshooting

- **The pool did not come up after a reboot.** `gh` may keep its token in a desktop keyring that stays
  locked until you log in. The service retries every minute and comes up at login; until then jobs run
  hosted. For starts before login, give the runner token Variables write (step 1).
- **Jobs are stuck "Waiting for a runner" with the machine off.** The machine went down without a clean
  stop (power loss, crash), so `TN_RUNNER` is still set. Run the kill switch above, or boot the machine.
- **A template lane fails with a capture or GPU-device error.** `tower-defense` and `rain` are known
  flaky on both pools (see `docs/PRDs/CI/EXECUTION-ORDER.md`). Rerun the failed jobs once.
- **The runner list shows offline `tn-*` runners.** Runners stopped while idle stay registered. `up` and
  `down` delete them.
- **Timing.** A full board takes about as long as hosted (42 min against 39), but uses no hosted
  minutes. Several pull requests at once queue on the 5 slots.
